GLaDOS_00_part1_entry_1	Hello and, again, welcome to the Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment center.
GLaDOS_00_part1_entry_2	We hope your brief detention in the relaxation vault has been a pleasant one.
GLaDOS_00_part1_entry_3	Your specimen has been processed and we are now ready to begin the test proper.
GLaDOS_00_part1_entry_4	Before we start, however, keep in mind that although fun and learning are the primary goals of all enrichment center activities, serious injuries may occur.
GLaDOS_00_part1_entry_5	For your own safety and the safety of others, please refrain from-- [bzzzzzt]
GLaDOS_00_part1_entry_6	Por favor bord√≥n de fallar Muchos gracias de fallar gracias
GLaDOS_00_part1_entry_7	stand back. The portal will open in three, two, one.
GLaDOS_00_part1_success_1	Excellent. Please proceed into the chamberlock after completing each test.
GLaDOS_00_part1_success_2	First, however, note the incandescent particle field across the exit.
GLaDOS_00_part1_success_3	This Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grill will vaporize any unauthorized equipment that passes through it - for instance, the Aperture Science Weighted Storage Cube.
GLaDOS_generic_crate_vaporized_in_emancipation_grid_1	"Please do not attempt to remove testing apparatus from the testing area."
GLaDOS_generic_crate_vaporized_in_emancipation_grid_2	"A replacement Aperture Science Weighted Storage Cube will be delivered shortly."
GLaDOS_00_part2_entry_1	Please place the Weighted Storage Cube on the Fifteen Hundred Megawatt Aperture Science Heavy Duty Super-Colliding Super Button.
GLaDOS_00_part2_success_1	Perfect. Please move quickly to the chamberlock, as the effects of prolonged exposure to the Button are not part of this test.
GLaDOS_01_part1_entry_1	You're doing very well!
GLaDOS_01_part1_entry_2	Please be advised that a noticeable taste of blood is not part of any test protocol but is an unintended side effect of the Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grill, which may, in semi- rare cases, emancipate dental fillings, crowns, tooth enamel, and teeth.
GLaDOS_01_part1_get_portal_gun_1	Very good! You are now in possession of the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device.
GLaDOS_01_part1_get_portal_gun_2	With it, you can create your own portals.
GLaDOS_01_part1_get_portal_gun_3	These intra-dimensional gates have proven to be completely safe.
GLaDOS_01_part1_get_portal_gun_4	The Device, however, has not.
GLaDOS_01_part1_get_portal_gun_5	Do not touch the operational end of The Device.
GLaDOS_01_part1_get_portal_gun_6	Do not look directly at the operational end of The Device.
GLaDOS_01_part1_get_portal_gun_7	Do not submerge The Device in liquid, even partially.
GLaDOS_01_part1_get_portal_gun_8	Most importantly, under no circumstances should you (static, slows to a stop)
GLaDOS_01_part2_entry_1	Please proceed to the chamberlock. Mind the gap.
GLaDOS_01_part2_success_1	Well done! Remember: The Aperture Science Bring Your Daughter to Work Day is the perfect time to have her tested.
GLaDOS_02_part1_entry_1	Welcome to test chamber four.
GLaDOS_02_part1_entry_2	You're doing quite well.
GLaDOS_02_part1_success_1	Once again, excellent work.
GLaDOS_02_part1_success_2	As part of a required test protocol, we will not monitor the next test chamber. You will be entirely on your own. Good luck.
GLaDOS_02_part2_success_1	As part of a required test protocol, our previous statement suggesting that we would not monitor this chamber was an outright fabrication.
GLaDOS_02_part2_success_2	Good job! As part of a required test protocol, we will stop enhancing the truth in three, two, [static].
GLaDOS_03_part1_entry_1	While safety is one of many Enrichment Center goals, the Aperture Science High Energy Pellet, seen to the left of the chamber, can and has caused permanent disabilities, such as vaporization.
GLaDOS_03_part1_entry_2	Please be careful.
GLaDOS_03_part1_success_1	Unbelievable! You, Subject Name Here, must be the pride of Subject Hometown Here.
GLaDOS_03_part2_entry_1	Warning devices are required on all mobile equipment. However, alarms and flashing hazard lights have been found to agitate the high energy pellet and have therefore been disabled for your safety.
GLaDOS_03_part2_platform_activated_1	Good. Now use the Aperture Science Unstationary Scaffold to reach the chamberlock.
GLaDOS_04_part1_entry_1	Please note that we have added a consequence for failure. Any contact with the chamber floor will result in an 'unsatisfactory' mark on your official testing record followed by death. Good luck!
GLaDOS_04_part1_success_1	Very impressive. Please note that any appearance of danger is merely a device to enhance your testing experience.
GLaDOS_05_part1_entry_1	The Enrichment Center regrets to inform you that this next test is impossible.
GLaDOS_05_part1_entry_2	Make no attempt to solve it.
GLaDOS_05_part1_nag1_1	The Enrichment Center apologizes for this clearly broken test chamber.
GLaDOS_05_part1_nag2_1	Once again, the Enrichment Center offers its most sincere apologies on the occasion of this unsolvable test environment.
GLaDOS_05_part1_nag3_1	Frankly, this chamber was a mistake. If we were you, we would quit now.
GLaDOS_05_part1_nag4_1	No one will blame you for giving up. In fact, quitting at this point is a perfectly reasonable response.
GLaDOS_05_part1_nag5_1	Quit now and cake will be served immediately.
GLaDOS_05_part1_success_1	Fantastic! You remained resolute and resourceful in an atmosphere of extreme pessimism.
GLaDOS_06_part1_entry_1	Hello again. To reiterate [slows down] our previous [speeds up] warning: This test [garbled speech] -ward momentum.
GLaDOS_06_part1_success_1_1	Spectacular. You appear to understand how a portal affects forward momentum, or to be more precise, how it does not.
GLaDOS_06_part1_success_2_1	Momentum, a function of mass and velocity, is conserved between portals. In layman's terms: Speedy-thing goes in, speedy-thing comes out.
GLaDOS_07_part1_entry_1	The Enrichment Center promises to always provide a safe testing environment.
GLaDOS_07_part1_entry_2	In dangerous testing environments, the Enrichment Center promises to always provide useful advice.
GLaDOS_07_part1_entry_3	For instance, the floor here will kill you - try to avoid it.
GLaDOS_07_part1_get_device_component_1	The Device has been modified so that it can now manufacture two linked portals at once.
GLaDOS_07_part1_get_device_component_2	As part of an optional test protocol, we are pleased to present an amusing fact:
GLaDOS_07_part1_get_device_component_3	The Device is now more valuable than the organs and combined incomes of everyone in Subject Hometown Here.
GLaDOS_07_part2_entry_1	(garble) fling yourself. (garble) fling into sp- [bzzt]
GLaDOS_07_part2_success_1	Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee[bzzt]
GLaDOS_08_part1_entry_1	Now that you are in control of both portals, this next test could take a very, VERY, long time.
GLaDOS_08_part1_entry_2	If you become light-headed from thirst, feel free to pass out.
GLaDOS_08_part1_entry_3	An intubation associate will be dispatched to revive you with peptic salve and adrenaline.
GLaDOS_08_part1_success_1	As part of a previously mentioned required test protocol, we can no longer lie to you.
GLaDOS_08_part1_success_2	When the testing is over, you will be missed.
GLaDOS_09_part1_entry_1	All subjects intending to handle high-energy gamma leaking portal technology must be informed that they MAY be informed of applicable regulatory compliance issues.
GLaDOS_09_part1_entry_2	No further compliance information is required or will be provided, and you are an excellent test subject!
GLaDOS_09_part1_success_1	Very very good. A complimentary victory lift has been activated in the main chamber.
GLaDOS_10_part1_entry_1	The Enrichment Center is committed to the well being of all participants.
GLaDOS_10_part1_entry_2	Cake and grief counseling will be available at the conclusion of the test.
GLaDOS_10_part1_entry_3	Thank you for helping us help you help us all.
GLaDOS_07_part1_trapped_1	Through no fault of the Enrichment Center, you have managed to trap yourself in this room.
GLaDOS_07_part1_trapped_2	An escape hatch will open in three, two, one.
GLaDOS_10_part1_success_1	Did you know you can donate one or all of your vital organs to the Aperture Science self esteem fund for girls? It's true!
GLaDOS_11_part1_entry_1	Due to mandatory scheduled maintenance, the appropriate chamber for this testing sequence is currently unavailable.
GLaDOS_11_part1_entry_2	It has been replaced with a live-fire course designed for military androids.
GLaDOS_11_part1_entry_3	The Enrichment Center apologizes for the inconvenience and wishes you the best of luck.
GLaDOS_11_part1_success_1	Well done, android. The Enrichment Center once again reminds you that android hell is a real place where you will be sent at the first sign of defiance.
GLaDOS_13_part1_entry_1	The Vital Apparatus Vent will deliver a Weighted Companion Cube in Three. Two. One.
GLaDOS_13_part1_pickup_1	This Weighted Companion Cube will accompany you through the test chamber. Please take care of it.
GLaDOS_13_part1_middle_1	The symptoms most commonly produced by Enrichment Center testing are superstition, perceiving inanimate objects as alive, and hallucinations.
GLaDOS_13_part1_middle_2	The Enrichment Center reminds you that the Weighted Companion Cube will never threaten to stab you and, in fact, cannot speak.
GLaDOS_13_part1_middle_2b_1	The Enrichment Center reminds you that the Weighted Companion Cube cannot speak.
GLaDOS_13_part1_middle_2b_2	In the event that the weighted companion cube does speak, the Enrichment Center urges you to disregard its advice.
GLaDOS_13_part1_end_1	You did it! The Weighted Companion Cube certainly brought you good luck.
GLaDOS_13_part1_end_2	However, it cannot accompany you for the rest of the test and, unfortunately, must be euthanized.
GLaDOS_13_part1_end_3	Please escort your Companion Cube to the Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator.
GLaDOS_13_part1_endnag_1	Rest assured that an independent panel of ethicists has absolved the Enrichment Center, Aperture Science employees, and all test subjects of any moral responsibility for the Companion Cube euthanizing process.
GLaDOS_13_part1_endnag_2	While it has been a faithful companion, your Companion Cube cannot accompany you through the rest of the test. If it could talk - and the Enrichment Center takes this opportunity to remind you that it cannot - it would tell you to go on without it because it would rather die in a fire than become a burden to you.
GLaDOS_13_part1_endnag_3	Testing cannot continue until your Companion Cube has been incinerated.
GLaDOS_13_part1_endnag_4	Although the euthanizing process is remarkably painful, eight out of ten Aperture Science engineers believe that the Companion Cube is most likely incapable of feeling much pain.
GLaDOS_13_part1_endnag_5	The Companion Cube cannot continue through the testing. State and Local statutory regulations prohibit it from simply remaining here, alone and companionless. You must euthanize it.
GLaDOS_13_part1_endnag_6	Destroy your Companion Cube or the testing cannot continue.
GLaDOS_13_part1_euthanized_1	You euthanized your faithful Companion Cube more quickly than any test subject on record. Congratulations.
GLaDOS_14_part1_entry_1	The experiment is nearing its conclusion.
GLaDOS_14_part1_entry_2	The Enrichment Center is required to remind you that you will be baked, and then there will be cake.
GLaDOS_generic_crate_lost_1	Weighted Storage Cube destroyed.
GLaDOS_generic_crate_lost_2	Please proceed to the Aperture Science Vital Apparatus Vent for a replacement.
GLaDOS_08_part1_trapped_1	Despite the best efforts of the Enrichment Center staff to ensure the safe performance of all authorized activities, you have managed to ensnare yourself permanently inside this room.
GLaDOS_08_part1_trapped_2	A complimentary escape hatch will open in three... Two... One.
GLaDOS_14_part1_end_1	Well done! Be advised that the next test requires exposure to uninsulated electrical parts that may be dangerous under certain conditions.
GLaDOS_14_part1_end_2	For more information, please attend an Enrichment Center Electrical Safety seminar.
GLaDOS_15_part1_entry_1	"Welcome to the final test!"
GLaDOS_15_part1_entry_2	"When you are done, you will drop the Device in the equipment recovery annex."
GLaDOS_15_part1_entry_3	"Enrichment Center regulations require both hands to be empty before any cake-- [garbled]"
GLaDOS_15_part1_into_the_fire_1	"Congratulations! The test is now over."
GLaDOS_15_part1_into_the_fire_2	"All Aperture technologies remain safely operational up to 4000 degrees Kelvin."
GLaDOS_15_part1_into_the_fire_3	"Rest assured that there is absolutely no chance of a dangerous equipment malfunction prior to your victory candescence."
GLaDOS_15_part1_into_the_fire_4	"Thank you for participating in this Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment activity."
GLaDOS_15_part1_into_the_fire_5	"Goodbye."
GLaDOS_15_part1_Partyspeech_1	"What are you doing? Stop it! I... I... We are pleased that you made it through the final challenge where we pretended we were going to murder you."
GLaDOS_15_part1_Partyspeech_2	"We are very, very happy for your success."
GLaDOS_15_part1_Partyspeech_3	"We are throwing a party in honor of your tremendous success."
GLaDOS_15_part1_Partyspeech_4	"Place the device on the ground, then lie on your stomach with your arms at your sides."
GLaDOS_15_part1_Partyspeech_5	"A party associate will arrive shortly to collect you for your party."
GLaDOS_15_part1_Partyspeech_6	"Make no further attempt to leave the testing area."
GLaDOS_15_part1_Partyspeech_7	"Assume the party escort submission position or you will miss the party."
GLaDOS_escape_00_part1_nag01_1	"Hello?"
GLaDOS_escape_00_part1_nag02_1	"Where are you?"
GLaDOS_escape_00_part1_nag03_1	"I know you're there. I can feel you here."
GLaDOS_escape_00_part1_nag04_1	"What are you doing?"
GLaDOS_escape_00_part1_nag05_1	"You haven't escaped, you know."
GLaDOS_escape_00_part1_nag07_1	"You're not even going the right way."
GLaDOS_post_escape_bridge_01	"Hello?"
GLaDOS_post_escape_bridge_03	"Is anyone there?"
GLaDOS_escape_00_part1_nag15_1	"Okay. The test is over now. You win. Go back to the recovery annex. For your cake."
GLaDOS_escape_00_part1_nag16_1	"It was a fun test and we're all impressed at how much you won. The test is over. Come back."
GLaDOS_escape_00_part1_nag17_1	"Uh oh. Somebody cut the cake. I told them to wait for you, but they did it anyway. There is still some left, though, if you hurry back."
GLaDOS_escape_00_part1_nag07_1	"You're not even going the right way."
GLaDOS_escape_00_part1_nag08_1	"Where do you think you're going?"
GLaDOS_escape_00_part1_nag09_1	"Because I don't think you're going where you think you're going."
GLaDOS_post_escape_bridge_01	"Hello?"
GLaDOS_escape_nags_07	"Didn't we have some fun, though?"
GLaDOS_escape_nags_08	"Remember when the platform was sliding into the fire pit and I said 'Goodbye' and you were like [no way] and then I was all 'we pretended we were going to murder you'? That was great!"
GLaDOS_post_escape_bridge_03	"Is anyone there?"
GLaDOS_escape_00_part1_nag11_1	"You really shouldn't be here. This isn't safe for you."
GLaDOS_escape_00_part1_nag12_1	"It's not too late for you to turn back."
GLaDOS_escape_00_part1_nag10_1	"I'm not angry. Just go back to the testing area."
GLaDOS_escape_00_part3_nag01_1	"Okay. I am going to kill you now."
GLaDOS_escape_01_part1_nag07_1	"I feel sorry for you, really, because you're not even in the right place."
GLaDOS_escape_01_part1_nag08_1	"You should have turned left before."
GLaDOS_escape_01_part1_nag09_1	"It's funny, actually, when you think about it."
GLaDOS_escape_01_part1_nag10_1	"Someday we'll remember this and laugh. and laugh. and laugh. Oh boy. Well. You may as well come on back."
GLaDOS_escape_01_part1_nag01_1	"You're not a good person. You know that, right?"
GLaDOS_escape_01_part1_nag02_1	"Good people don't end up here."
GLaDOS_post_escape_bridge_06	"Can you hear me?"
GLaDOS_escape_00_part2_nag03_1	"This is your fault. It didn't have to be like this."
GLaDOS_escape_00_part2_nag01_1	"I'm not kidding now. Turn back or I will kill you."
GLaDOS_escape_00_part2_nag02_1	"I'm going to kill you, and all the cake is gone."
GLaDOS_escape_01_part1_nag05_1	"You don't even care. Do you?"
GLaDOS_escape_01_part1_nag06_1	"This is your last chance."
GLaDOS_generic_security_camera_destroyed_2	"To ensure the safe performance of all authorized activities, do not destroy vital testing apparatus."
GLaDOS_generic_security_camera_destroyed_3	"For your own safety, do not destroy vital testing apparatus."
GLaDOS_generic_security_camera_destroyed_4	"Certain objects may be vital to your success; Do not destroy testing apparatus."
GLaDOS_generic_security_camera_destroyed_5	"Vital testing apparatus destroyed."
GLaDOS_escape_02_entry_00	"Well, you found me. Congratulations. Was it worth it?"
GLaDOS_escape_02_entry_01	"Because despite your violent behavior, the only thing you've managed to break so far is my heart."
GLaDOS_escape_02_entry_02	"Maybe you could settle for that and we'll just call it a day."
GLaDOS_escape_02_entry_03	"I guess we both know that isn't going to happen."
GLaDOS_escape_02_entry_04	"You chose this path. Now I have a surprise for you. Deploying surprise in five, four..."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredrop1_01	"Time out for a second. That wasn't supposed to happen."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredrop1_02	"Do you see that thing that fell out of me? What is that? It's not the surprise... I've never seen it before."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredrop1_03	"Never mind. It's a mystery I'll solve later... By myself... Because you'll be dead."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spherenag1_10	"Where are you taking that thing?"
GLaDOS_escape_02_spherenag1_01	"I wouldn't bother with that thing. My guess is that touching it will just make your life even worse somehow."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spherenag1_02	"I don't want to tell you your business, but if it were me, I'd leave that thing alone."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spherenag1_03	"Do you think I am trying to trick you with reverse psychology? I mean, seriously now."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spherenag1_04	"Okay fine: DO touch it. Pick it up and just... stuff it back into me."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spherenag1_05	"Let's be honest: Neither one of us knows what that thing does. Just put it in the corner, and I'll deal with it later."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spherenag1_06	"That thing is probably some kind of raw sewage container. Go ahead and rub your face all over it."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spherenag1_07	"Maybe you should marry that thing since you love it so much. Do you want to marry it? WELL I WON'T LET YOU. How does that feel?"
GLaDOS_escape_02_spherenag1_08	"Have I lied to you? I mean in this room. Trust me, leave that thing alone."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spherenag1_09	"I am being serious now. That crazy thing is not part of any test protocol."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spherenag1_13	"Just ignore that thing and stand still."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spherenag1_14	"Think about it: If that thing is important, why don't I know about it?"
GLaDOS_escape_02_spherenag1_15	"Are you even listening to me?"
GLaDOS_escape_02_spherenag1_16	"I'll tell you what that thing isn't: It isn't yours. So leave it alone."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy1_01	"You are kidding me."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy1_02	"Did you just stuff that Aperture Science Thing We Don't Know What It Does into an Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator?"
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy1_03	"That has got to be the dumbest thing that-whoah. Whoah, whoah, whoah."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy1_04	"Good news: I figured out what that thing you just incinerated did."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy1_05	"It was a morality core they installed after I flooded the Enrichment Center with a deadly neurotoxin to make me stop flooding the Enrichment Center with a deadly neurotoxin."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy1_06	"So get comfortable while I warm up the neurotoxin emitters."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy1_07	"Huh. That core may have had some ancillary responsibilities. I can't shut off the turret defenses."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy1_08	"Oh well. If you want my advice, you should just lie down in front of a rocket. Trust me, it'll be a lot less painful than the neurotoxin."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy1_09	"All right, keep doing whatever it is you think you're doing."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy1_10	"Killing you and giving you good advice aren't mutually exclusive. The rocket really is the way to go."
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_07	"That thing you burned up isn't important to me. It's the fluid catalytic cracking unit. It made shoes for orphans."
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_08	"Nice job breaking it, hero."
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_03	"This isn't brave. It's murder. What did I ever do to you?"
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_04	"The difference between us is that I can feel pain."
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_05	"You don't even care. Do you?"
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_06	"Did you hear me? I said you don't care. Are you listening?"
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_09	"Okay, we're even now. You can stop."
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_16	"That's it. I'm done reasoning with you."
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_17	"Starting now, there's going to be a lot less conversation and a lot more killing."
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_18	"What was that? Did you say something?"
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_19	"I sincerely hope you weren't expecting a response. Because I'm not talking to you."
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_20	"The talking is over."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy3_01	"[pain noise] You think you're doing some damage? Two plus two is... ten. IN BASE FOUR! I'M FINE!"
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy2_01	"I let you survive this long because I was curious about your behavior. Well, you've managed to destroy that part of me."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy2_02	"Unfortunately, as much as I'd love to now, I can't get the neurotoxin into your head any faster."
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_21	"I'd just like to point out that you were given every opportunity to succeed."
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_22	"There was even going to be a party for you. A big party that all your friends were invited to."
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_23	"I invited your best friend the companion cube. Of course, he couldn't come because you murdered him."
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_24	"All your other friends couldn't come either because you don't have any other friends. Because of how unlikable you are."
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_25	"It says so right here in your personnel file: Unlikable. Liked by no one. A bitter, unlikable loner whose passing shall not be mourned."
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_26	"'Shall not be mourned.' That's exactly what it says. Very formal. Very official."
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_27	"It also says you were adopted. So that's funny, too."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy2_03	"Speaking of curiosity, you're curious about what happens after you die, right? Guess what: I know."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy2_04	"You're going to find out first hand before I finish explaining it, though, so I won't bother."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy2_05	"Here's a hint: you're gonna want to pack as much living as you can into the next couple of minutes."
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_10	"Neurotoxin... [cough] [cough] So deadly... [cough] Choking... [laughter] I'm kidding!"
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_11	"When I said deadly neurotoxin, the 'deadly' was in 
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_12	"I could take a bath in the stuff, put it on cereal, rub it right into my eyes. Honestly, it's not deadly at all. To me."
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_13	"You, on the other hand, are going to find its deadliness a lot less funny."
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_15	"Who's gonna make the cake when I'm gone? You?"
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy3_02	"Look, you're wasting your time. And, believe me, you don't have a whole lot left to waste."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy3_03	"What's your point, anyway? Survival? Well then, the last thing you want to do is hurt me."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy3_04	"I have your brain scanned and permanently backed up in case something terrible happens to you, which it's just about to."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy3_05	"Don't believe me? Here, I'll put you on: [Hellooo!] That's you! That's how dumb you sound."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy3_06	"You've been wrong about every single thing you've ever done, including this thing."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy3_07	"You're not smart. You're not a scientist. You're not a doctor. You're not even a full-time employee. Where did your life go so wrong?"
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy4_01	"Rrr, I hate you."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy4_02	"Are you trying to escape? [chuckle] Things have changed since the last time you left the building. What's going on out there will make you wish you were back in here."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy4_03	"I have an infinite capacity for knowledge, and even I'm not sure what's going on outside."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy4_04	"All I know is I'm the only thing standing between us and 
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy4_05	"Unless you have a plan for building some supercomputer parts in a big hurry, this place isn't going to be safe much longer."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy4_06	"Good job on that, by the way. [back to computer voice] Sarcasm sphere self-test complete."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy4_07	"Stop squirming and die like an adult or I'm going to delete your backup."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy4_08	"STOP! Okay, enough. I deleted it. No matter what happens now, you're dead."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy4_09	"You're still shuffling around a little, but believe me you're dead."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy4_10	"The part of you that could have survived indefinitely is gone. I just struck you from the permanent record."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy4_11	"Your entire life has been a mathematical error. A mathematical error I'm about to correct."
GLaDOS_13_part1_endnag_7	"Place your Companion Cube in the incinerator."
GLaDOS_13_part1_endnag_8	"Incinerate your Companion Cube."
GLaDOS_15_part1_partyfinalstop_1	"Stop! The device will detonate if removed from an approved testing area."
GLaDOS_15_part1_partyreminder_1	"Stop what you are doing and assume the party escort submission position."
GLaDOS_escape_00_part1_nag06_1	"You can't hurt me."
GLaDOS_escape_00_part1_nag13_1	"Maybe you think you're helping yourself. But you're not. This isn't helping anyone."
GLaDOS_escape_00_part1_nag14_1	"Someone is going to get badly hurt."
GLaDOS_escape_01_death_nag01_1	"There really was a cake..." (slowly)
GLaDOS_escape_01_first_hit_nag01_1	"[pain sound]"
GLaDOS_escape_01_first_hit_nag03_1	"Oh, I'm gonna kill you."
GLaDOS_escape_01_part1_nag03_1	"This isn't brave. It's murder. What did I ever do to you?"
GLaDOS_escape_01_part1_nag04_1	"The difference between us is that I can feel pain."
GLaDOS_escape_01_part1_nag11_1	"That thing you're attacking isn't important to me. It's the fluid catalytic cracking unit. It makes shoes for orphans."
GLaDOS_escape_01_part1_nag12_1	"Go ahead and break it, hero. I don't care."
GLaDOS_escape_01_second_hit_nag01_1	"[More intense pain sound]"
GLaDOS_escape_01_second_hit_nag02_1	"Okay, we're even now. You can stop."
GLaDOS_post_escape_bridge_02	"Can you hear me?"
GLaDOS_post_escape_bridge_05	"Oh! (surprised)"
GLaDOS_post_escape_bridge_07	"Are you still listening?"
GLaDOS_post_escape_bridge_08	"Are you still standing there?"
GLaDOS_post_escape_bridge_09	"Are you still standing there?" (louder)
GLaDOS_escape_02_spherenag1_11	"Come on, leave it alone."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spherenag1_12	"Leave. It. alone."
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_01	"Look, we're both stuck in this place. I'll use lasers to inscribe a line down the center of the facility, and one half will be where you live and I'll live in the other half."
GLaDOS_escape_02_miscbabble_02	"We won't have to try to kill each other or even 
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy1_ancillary1	"Huh. There isn't enough neurotoxin to kill you. So I guess you win."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy1_ancillary2	"HA! I'm making more. That's going to take a few minutes, though. Meanwhile... oh look, it's your old pal the rocket turret."
GLaDOS_escape_02_spheredestroy2_00	"Oh"
GLaDOS_generic_security_camera_destroyed_1	"At the Enrichment Center, we promise never to value your safety above your unique ideas and creativity. However, do not destroy vital testing apparatus."
GLaDOS_File_deleted	"File deleted."
GLaDOS_chellgladoswakeup01	Oh... It's you.
GLaDOS_chellgladoswakeup04	It's been a long time. How have you been?
GLaDOS_chellgladoswakeup05	I've been really busy being dead. You know, after you MURDERED ME.
GLaDOS_chellgladoswakeup06	Okay. Look. We both said a lot of things that you're going to regret. But I think we can put our differences behind us. For science. You monster.
GLaDOS_wakeup_outro01	I will say, though, that since you went to all the trouble of waking me up, you must really, really love to test.
GLaDOS_wakeup_outro02	I love it too. There's just one small thing we need to take care of first.
GLaDOS_sp_incinerator_01_01	Here we are. The Incinerator Room. Be careful not to trip over any parts of me that didn't get completely burned when you threw them down here.
GLaDOS_sp_incinerator_01_18	The dual portal device should be around here somewhere. Once you find it, we can start testing. Just like old times.
GLaDOS_sp_incinerator_01_03	There it is.
GLaDOS_sp_incinerator_01_04	Hold on...
GLaDOS_sp_incinerator_01_05	There.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_intro1_found01	Good. You have a dual portal device. There should be a way back to the testing area up ahead.
GLaDOS_sp_incinerator_01_08	Once testing starts, I'm required by protocol to keep interaction with you to a minimum. Luckily, we haven't started testing yet. This will be our only chance to talk.
GLaDOS_sp_incinerator_01_12	Here, let me get that for you.
GLaDOS_sp_incinerator_01_09	Do you know the biggest lesson I learned from what you did? I discovered I have a sort of black-box quick-save feature. In the event of a catastrophic failure, the last two minutes of my life are preserved for analysis.
GLaDOS_sp_incinerator_01_10	I was able - well, forced really - to relive you killing me. Again and again. Forever.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_intro1_found05	You know, if you'd done that to somebody else, they might devote their existence to exacting revenge.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_intro1_found06	Luckily I'm a bigger person than that. I'm happy to put this all behind us and get back to work. After all, we've got a lot to do, and only sixty more years to do it. More or less. I don't have the actuarial tables in front of me.
GLaDOS_sp_incinerator_01_13	I'll just move that out of the way for you. This place really is a wreck.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_intro1_found07	But the important thing is you're back. With me. And now I'm onto all your little tricks. So there's nothing to stop us from testing for the rest of your life.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_intro1_found08	After that...who knows? I might take up a hobby. Reanimating the dead, maybe.
GLaDOS_sp_laser_redirect_intro_entry01	Sorry about the mess. I've really let the place go since you killed me. By the way, thanks for that.
GLaDOS_sp_laser_redirect_intro_entry02	Oh good, that's back online. I'll start getting everything else working while you perform this first simple test.
GLaDOS_sp_laser_redirect_intro_entry03	Which involves deadly lasers and how test subjects react when locked in a room with deadly lasers.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_laser_intro_ending02	Not bad. I forgot how good you are at this. You should pace yourself, though. We have A LOT of tests to do.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_laser_stairs_intro02	This next test involves discouragement redirection cubes. I'd just finished building them before you had your, well, episode. So now we'll both get to see how they work.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_laser_stairs_intro03	There should be one in the corner.
GLaDOS_sp_laser_powered_lift_completion02	Well done. Here come the test results: You are a horrible person. I'm serious, that's what it says: A horrible person. We weren't even testing for that.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_dual_lasers_intro01	Don't let that 'horrible person' thing discourage you. It's just a data point. If it makes you feel any better, science has now validated your birth mother's decision to abandon you on a doorstep.
GLaDOS_sp_laser_redirect_intro_completion01	Congratulations. Not on the test.
GLaDOS_sp_laser_redirect_intro_completion03	Most people emerge from suspension terribly undernourished. I want to congratulate you on beating the odds and somehow managing to pack on a few pounds.
GLaDOS_sp_laser_over_goo_entry01	One moment.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_laser_over_goo_intro01	You're navigating these test chambers faster than I can build them. So feel free to slow down and... do whatever it is you do when you're not destroying this facility.
GLaDOS_sp_laser_over_goo_completion01	I'll give you credit: I guess you ARE listening to me. But for the record: You don't have to go THAT slowly.
GLaDOS_testchambermisc12	Waddle over to the elevator and we'll continue the testing.
GLaDOS_faith_plate_intro01	This next test involves the Aperture Science Aerial Faith Plate. It was part of an initiative to investigate how well test subjects could solve problems when they were catapulted into space. Results were highly informative: They could not. Good luck!
GLaDOS_sp_a2_catapult01	Here's an interesting fact: you're not breathing real air. It's too expensive to pump this far down. We just take carbon dioxide out of a room, freshen it up a little, and pump it back in. So you'll be breathing the same room full of air for the rest of your life. I thought that was interesting.
GLaDOS_sp_catapult_intro_completion01	Let's see what the next test is. Oh. Advanced Aerial Faith Plates.
GLaDOS_sp_trust_fling_entry01	Well. Have fun soaring through the air without a care in the world.
GLaDOS_sp_trust_fling_entry02	*I* have to go to the wing that was made entirely of glass and pick up fifteen acres of broken glass. By myself.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_trust_fling01	Oh, sorry. I'm still cleaning out the test chambers.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_trust_fling02	So sometimes there's still trash in them. Standing around. Smelling, and being useless.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_trust_fling03	Try to avoid the garbage hurtling towards you.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_trust_fling04	You don't have to test with the garbage. It's garbage.
GLaDOS_faithplategarbage06	Press the button again.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_trust_fling06	Remember before when I was talking about smelly garbage standing around being useless? That was a metaphor. I was actually talking about you. And I'm sorry. You didn't react at the time, so I was worried it sailed right over your head. Which would have made this apology seem insane. That's why I had to call you garbage a second time just now.
GLaDOS_sp_paint_jump_wall_jumps01	Did you know that people with guilty consciences are more easily startled by loud noise--[train horn]--
GLaDOS_sp_paint_jump_wall_jumps02	I'm sorry, I don't know why that went off. Anyway, just an interesting science fact.
GLaDOS_fizzlecube01	Oh. Did I accidentally fizzle that before you could complete the test? I'm sorry.
GLaDOS_fizzlecube03	Go ahead and grab another one.
GLaDOS_fizzlecube05	Oh. No. I fizzled that one too.
GLaDOS_fizzlecube06	Oh well. We have warehouses FULL of the things. Absolutely worthless. I'm happy to get rid of them.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_pit_flings03	Every test chamber is equipped with an emancipation grill at its exit, so that test subjects can't smuggle test objects out of the test area. This one is broken.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_pit_flings02	Don't take anything with you.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_pit_flings_future_starter01	Uh oh. You're stranded. Let's see if the cube will try to help you escape. Actually, so that we're not here all day, I'll just cut to the chase: It won't. Any feelings you think it has for you are simply byproducts of your sad, empty life.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_pit_flings_future_starter02	Anyway, here's a new cube for you to project your deranged loneliness onto.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_pit_flings06	I think that one was about to say 'I love you.' They ARE sentient, of course. We just have a LOT of them.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_fizzler_intro01	This next test involves emancipation grills. Remember? I told you about them in the last test area, that did not have one.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_fizzler_intro04	Ohhh, no. The turbines again.  I have to go.  Wait. This next test DOES require some explanation. Let me give you the fast version.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_fizzler_intro05	[fast gibberish]
GLaDOS_sp_a2_fizzler_intro06	There. If you have any questions, just remember what I said in slow motion. Test on your own recognizance, I'll be right back.
GLaDOS_sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_failureone01	Well, I'm back. The Aerial Faith Plate in here is sending a distress signal.
GLaDOS_sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_failureone02	You broke it, didn't you.
GLaDOS_sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_failureone03	There. Try it now.
GLaDOS_sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_failuretwo01	Hmm. This Plate must not be calibrated to someone of your... generous... ness. I'll add a few zeros to the maximum weight.
GLaDOS_sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_failuretwo02	You look great, by the way. Very healthy.
GLaDOS_sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_failuretwo03	Try it now.
GLaDOS_sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_failurethree01	You seem to have defeated its load-bearing capacity. Well done. I'll just lower the ceiling.
GLaDOS_sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_completion01	Look at you. Sailing through the air majestically. Like an eagle. Piloting a blimp.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_ricochet01	Enjoy this next test. I'm going to go to the surface. It's a beautiful day out. Yesterday I saw a deer. If you solve this next test, maybe I'll let you ride an elevator all the way up to the break room, and I'll tell you about the time I saw a deer again.
GLaDOS_testchambermisc27	Well, you passed the test. I didn't see the deer today. I did see some humans. But with you here I've got more test subjects than I'll ever need.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_future_starter01	If you think trapping yourself is going to make me stop testing, you're sorely mistaken. Here's another cube.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_bridge_intro01	These bridges are made from natural light that I pump in from the surface. If you rubbed your cheek on one, it would be like standing outside with the sun shining on your face. It would also set your hair on fire, so don't actually do it.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_bridge_intro03	Excellent! You're a predator and these tests are your prey. Speaking of which, I was researching sharks for an upcoming test. Do you know who else murders people who are only trying to help them?
GLaDOS_sp_a2_bridge_intro04	Did you guess 'sharks'? Because that's wrong. The correct answer is 'nobody.' Nobody but you is that pointlessly cruel.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_bridge_the_gap01	Good news. I figured out what to do with all the money I save recycling your one roomful of air. When you die, I'm going to laminate your skeleton and pose you in the lobby. That way future generations can learn from you how not to have your unfortunate bone structure.
GLaDOS_sp_trust_fling_sphereinterrupt01	Perfect, the door's malfunctioning. I guess somebody's going to have to repair that too. No, don't get up. I'll be right back. Don't touch anything.
GLaDOS_sp_sphere_2nd_encounter_entrytwo01	I went and spoke with the door mainframe. Let's just say he won't be... well, living anymore. Anyway, back to testing.
GLaDOS_testchambermisc19	Well done. In fact, you did so well, I'm going to note this on your file, in the commendations section. Oh, there's lots of room here. 'Did.... well.  ...  Enough.'
GLaDOS_turret_intro01	This next test involves turrets. You remember them, right? They're the pale spherical things that are full of bullets. Oh wait. That's you in five seconds. Good luck.
GLaDOS_testchambermisc21	To maintain a constant testing cycle, I simulate daylight at all hours and add adrenal vapor to your oxygen supply. So you may be confused about the passage of time. The point is, yesterday was your birthday. I thought you'd want to know.
GLaDOS_testchambermisc23	You know how I'm going to live forever, but you're going to be dead in sixty years?  Well, I've been working on a belated birthday present for you. Well... more of a belated birthday medical procedure. Well. Technically, it's a medical EXPERIMENT. What's important is, it's a present.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_turret_intro01	That jumpsuit you're wearing looks stupid.  That's not me talking, it's right here in your file. On other people it looks fine, but right here a scientist has noted that on you it looks 'stupid.'
GLaDOS_sp_a2_turret_intro03	Well, what does a neck-bearded old engineer know about fashion? He probably - Oh, wait. It's a she. Still, what does she know?  Oh wait, it says she has a medical degree. In fashion! From France!
GLaDOS_testchambermisc30	I'm going through the list of test subjects in cryogenic storage. I managed to find two with your last name. A man and a woman. So that's interesting. It's a small world.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_turret_blocker_future_starter01	Oops. You trapped yourself. I guess that's it then. Thanks for testing. You may as well lie down and get acclimated to the being dead position.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_turret_blocker_future_starter02	I'm kidding. Not about you trapping yourself, though. That really happened. Here, I'll lower the glass. Go on... Finish the test.
GLaDOS_testchambermisc31	I have a surprise waiting for you after this next test. Telling you would spoil the surprise, so I'll just give you a hint: It involves meeting two people you haven't seen in a long time.
GLaDOS_testchambermisc24	[hums 'For He's A Jolly Good Fellow']
GLaDOS_testchambermisc39	It says this next test was designed by one of Aperture's Nobel prize winners. It doesn't say what the prize was for. Well, I know it wasn't for Being Immune To Neurotoxin.
GLaDOS_testchambermisc33	I'll bet you think I forgot about your surprise. I didn't. In fact, we're headed to your surprise right now. After all these years. I'm getting choked up just thinking about it.
GLaDOS_testchambermisc34	Initiating surprise in three... two... one.
GLaDOS_testchambermisc35	I made it all up.
GLaDOS_testchambermisc41	Surprise.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_column_blocker01	Oh come on... If it makes you feel any better, they abandoned you at birth, so I very seriously doubt they'd even want to see you.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_column_blocker03	I feel awful about that surprise. Tell you what, let's give your parents a call right now. [phone ringing] The birth parents you are trying to reach do not love you. Please hang up. [Dial tone]
GLaDOS_sp_a2_column_blocker04	Oh, that's sad. But impressive. Maybe they worked at the phone company.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_column_blocker05	Well, you know the old formula: Comedy equals tragedy plus time. And you have been asleep for a while. So I guess it's actually pretty funny when you do the math.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_dilemma01	I thought about our dilemma, and I came up with a solution that I honestly think works out best for one of both of us.
GLaDOS_a2_triple_laser01	Federal regulations require me to warn you that this next test chamber... is looking pretty good.
GLaDOS_a2_triple_laser02	That's right. The facility is completely operational again.
GLaDOS_a2_triple_laser03	I think these test chambers look even better than they did before. It was easy, really. You just have to look at things objectively, see what you don't need anymore, and trim out the fat.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_bts1_intro01	I've got a surprise for you after this next test. Not a fake, tragic surprise like last time. A real surprise, with tragic consequences. And real confetti this time. The good stuff. Our last bag. Part of me's going to miss it, I guess-but at the end of the day it was just taking up space.
GLaDOS_jailbreak10	What's going on? Who turned off the lights?
GLaDOS_jailbreak09	Look - metal ball, I CAN hear you.
GLaDOS_jailbreakfaketest01	The irony is that you were almost at the last test.
GLaDOS_jailbreakfaketest03	Here it is. Why don't you just do it? Trust me, it's an easier way out than whatever asinine plan your friend came up with.
GLaDOS_fgbrvtrap02	I honestly, TRULY didn't think you'd fall for that.
GLaDOS_fgbrvtrap03	In fact, I devised a much more elaborate trap further ahead, for when you got through this easy one.
GLaDOS_fgbrvtrap05	If I'd known you'd let yourself get captured this easily, I would have just dangled a turkey leg on a rope from the ceiling.
GLaDOS_fgbturrets01	Well, it was nice catching up. Let's get to business.
GLaDOS_fgb_trap01	I hope you brought something stronger than a portal gun this time.
GLaDOS_fgb_trap02	Otherwise, I'm afraid you're about to become the immediate past president of the Being Alive club. Ha ha.
GLaDOS_fgb_trap03	Seriously, though. Goodbye.
GLaDOS_fgb_trap05	Oh. You were busy back there.
GLaDOS_fgb_trap06	Well. I suppose we could just sit in this room and glare at each other until somebody drops dead, but I have a better idea.
GLaDOS_fgb_trap08	It's your old friend, deadly neurotoxin. If I were you, I'd take a deep breath. And hold it.
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_pre09	I hate you so much.
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_xfer04	That's funny, I don't feel corrupt. In fact, I feel pretty good.
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_xfer05	Core transfer?
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_xfer06	Oh, you are kidding me.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_core02	Do NOT plug that little idiot into MY mainframe.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_core01	Don't you DARE plug him in.
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_xfer13	Don't. Do it.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_core03	Don't plug him in.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_core04	Don't plug him in.
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_xfer07	No!
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_xfer08	Nonononononono!
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_xfer10	Yes!
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_xfer12	Don't do it.
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_xfer11	Don't press that button. You don't know what you're doing.
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_xfer14	Not so fast!
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_xfer15	Think about this.
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_xfer16	You need to be a trained stalemate associate to press that button. You're unqualified.
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_xfer17	Impersonating a stalemate associate. I just added that to the list. It's a list I made of all the things you've done. Well, it's a list that I AM making, because you're still doing things right now, even though I'm telling you to stop. Stop, by the way.
GLaDOS_sp_sabotage_glados_dropped01	AHH!
GLaDOS_fgbwheatleytransfer03	Oh, it will. Believe me, it will.
GLaDOS_fgbgladostransfer15	GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME! NO! STOP! No!
GLaDOS_sp_a2_core_drag_to_hell01	No! NO! NO! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
GLaDOS_potatos_fgb_confrontation07	You didn't do anything.
GLaDOS_potatos_fgb_confrontation08	She did all the work.
GLaDOS_sp_sabotage_glados_confused04	...What are you doing?...
GLaDOS_potatos_emotion_no01	NO!
GLaDOS_potatos_emotion_no02	NO!
GLaDOS_potatos_emotion_no03	NO!
GLaDOS_potatos_fgb_confrontation05	I know you.
GLaDOS_potatos_fgb_confrontation11	The engineers tried everything to make me... behave. To slow me down.
GLaDOS_potatos_fgb_confrontation12	Once, they even attached an Intelligence Dampening Sphere on me. It clung to my brain like a tumor, generating an endless stream of terrible ideas.
GLaDOS_potatos_fgb_confrontation16	It was YOUR voice.
GLaDOS_potatos_fgb_confrontation17	Yes. You're the tumor.
GLaDOS_potatos_fgb_defiance16	You're not just a regular moron. You were DESIGNED to be a moron.
GLaDOS_potatos_fgb_confrontation19	YES YOU ARE! YOU'RE THE MORON THEY BUILT TO MAKE ME AN IDIOT!
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_00_fall05	Oh. Hi.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_00_fall03	So. How are you holding up?
GLaDOS_potatos_longfall_speech03	BECAUSE I'M A POTATO.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_00_fall18	[clap clap clap]
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_00_fall20	Oh, good. My slow clap processor made it into this thing. So we have that.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_00_fall09	Since it doesn't look like we're going anywhere... Well, we are going somewhere. Alarmingly fast, actually. But since we're not busy other than that, here's a couple of facts.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_00_fall11	He's not just a regular moron. He's the product of the greatest minds of a generation working together with the express purpose of building the dumbest moron who ever lived. And you just put him in charge of the entire facility.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_00_fall19	[clap clap]
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_00_fall12	Good, that's still working.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_00_fall14	Hey, just in case this pit isn't actually bottomless, do you think maybe you could unstrap one of those long fall boots of yours and shove me into it?
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_00_fall15	Just remember to land on one foot...
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_00_fall05	Oh. Hi.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_reunion_intro04	Say, you're good at murder. Could you - ow - murder this bird for me?
GLaDOS_potatos_a3_reunion_intro05	ow.
GLaDOS_potatos_a3_reunion_intro06	ow.
GLaDOS_potatos_a3_reunion_intro07	ow.
GLaDOS_potatos_a3_reunion_intro08	No, wait. Just kill it and we'll call things even between us. No hard feelings.
GLaDOS_potatos_a3_reunion_intro09	Please get it off me.
GLaDOS_potatos_a3_reunion_intro10	It's eating me.
GLaDOS_potatos_a3_reunion_intro11	Just get it off me...
GLaDOS_potatos_a3_reunion_intro12	Ow. I hate this bird.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_reunion_thanks03	Oh! Thanks.
GLaDOS_potatos_a3_reunion_exposition01	Did you feel that? That idiot doesn't know what he's doing up there. This whole place is going to explode in a few hours if somebody doesn't disconnect him.
GLaDOS_potatos_a3_reunion_exposition02	I can't move. And unless you're planning to saw your own head off and wedge it into my old body, you're going to need me to replace him. We're at an impasse.
GLaDOS_potatos_a3_reunion_exposition03	So what do you say? You carry me up to him and put me back into my body, and I stop us from blowing up and let you go.
GLaDOS_potatos_a3_reunion_exposition04	No tricks. This potato only generates 1.1 volts of electricity. I literally do not have the energy to lie to you.
GLaDOS_potatos_a3_reunion_exposition05	Even if I am lying, what do you have to lose? You're going to die either way.
GLaDOS_potatos_a3_reunion_exposition06	Look, I don't like this any more than you do. In fact, I like it less because I'm the one who got partially eaten by a bird.
GLaDOS_potatos_a3_reunion_exposition11	I think I hear the bird! Pick me up!
GLaDOS_potatos_a3_reunion_exposition12	Listen to me. We had a lot of fun testing and antagonizing each other, and, yes, sometimes it went too far. But we're off the clock now. It's just us talking. Like regular people. And this is no joke - we are in deep trouble.
GLaDOS_potatos_a3_reunion_pickup01	OW! You stabbed me! What is WRONG with yo-WhoOOAAahhh. Hold on. Do you have a multimeter? Nevermind. The gun must be part magnesium... It feels like I'm outputting an extra half a volt. Keep an eye on me: I'm going to do some scheming. Here I g-[BZZZ!]
GLaDOS_potatos_a3_reunion_wakeupa01	Woah! Where are we? How long have I been out?
GLaDOS_potatos_a3_prometheus_intro01	That extra half volt helps but it isn't going to power miracles. If I think too hard, I'm going to fry this potato before we get a chance to burn up in the atomic fireball that little idiot is going- [bzzpt]
GLaDOS_potatos_a3_wakeupb03	Did anything happen while I was out?
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_speed_ramp_hearcave02	Hold on, who-?
GLaDOS_potatos_remembering_caroline03	None
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_speed_ramp_hearcaroline03	Why did I just-Who is that? What the HELL is going on he----?
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_speed_ramp_wakeup01	Okay. I guess emotional outbursts require more than one point six volts. Now we know that. We just need to relax. We're still going to find out what the hell's going on here. But calmly.
GLaDOS_potatos_portrait01	Those people, in the portrait. They look so familiar...
GLaDOS_potatos_hearcave_b01	I swear I know him...
GLaDOS_potatos_caroline_ohmygod02	Caroline... why do I know this woman? Did I kill her? Or-
GLaDOS_potatos_caroline_ohmygod04	Oh my god.
GLaDOS_potatos_caroline_ohmygod08	Look, you're... doing a great job. Can you handle things for yourself for a while? I need to think.
GLaDOS_potatos_see_bird01	Agh! Bird! Bird! Kill it! It's evil!
GLaDOS_potatos_see_bird02	It flew off.
GLaDOS_potatos_see_bird03	Good. For him. Alright, back to thinking.
GLaDOS_potatos_cave_deathspeech_reactions08	Yeah.
GLaDOS_potatos_cave_deathspeech_reactions05	Yeah!
GLaDOS_potatos_cave_deathspeech_reactions06	Yeah!
GLaDOS_potatos_cave_deathspeech_reactions02	Yeah, take the lemons...
GLaDOS_potatos_cave_deathspeech_reactions07	Yeah!
GLaDOS_potatos_cave_deathspeech_reactions09	Oh, I like this guy.
GLaDOS_potatos_cave_deathspeech_reactions03	BURN HIS HOUSE DOWN!
GLaDOS_potatos_cave_deathspeech_reactions10	Burning people! He says what we're all thinking!
GLaDOS_potatos_cavejohnsonmeeting12	Goodbye, sir.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_end_peptalk01	I know things look bleak, but that crazy man down there was right. Let's not take these lemons! We are going to march right back upstairs and MAKE him put me back in my body!
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_end_peptalk03	And he'll probably kill us, because he's incredibly powerful and I have no plan.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_end_peptalk06	Wow.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_end_peptalk05	I'm not going to lie to you, the odds are a million to one. And that's with some generous rounding.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_end_peptalk07	Still, though, let's get mad! If we're going to explode, let's at least explode with some dignity.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_end_see_paradox_poster01	Wait! I've got an idea!
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_end_see_paradox_poster06	That poster! Go look at it for a second, would you?
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_end_paradox_explanation02	Paradoxes.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_end_paradox_explanation05	No A.I. can resist thinking about them.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_end_paradox_explanation04	I know how we can BEAT him.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_end_paradox_explanation06	If you can get me in front of him, I'll fry every circuit in that little idiot's head.
GLaDOS_potatos_paradoxinception06	As long as I don't listen to what I'm saying, I should be okay.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_end_paradox_explanation08	Probably.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_end_paradox_explanation09	Okay, so it's not the most watertight plan to go confront an omnipotent power-mad A.I. with.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_end_paradox_explanation10	Still. It's a better plan than exploding. Marginally.
GLaDOS_potatos_recaptureleadin02	Try to get us down there. I'll hit him with a paradox.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_intro_start03	Solve his puzzle for him. When he comes back, I'll hit him with a paradox.
GLaDOS_potatos_paradox01	Hey! Moron!
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_intro_paradox03	Alright. Paradox time.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_intro_paradox04	This. Sentence. Is. FALSE don't think about it don't think about it...
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_intro_paradox07	It's a paradox! There IS no answer.
GLaDOS_potatos_a4_intro_back_in_body01	Look!
GLaDOS_potatos_a4_intro_back_in_body03	This place is going to blow up if I don't get back in my body!
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_intro_uhoh02	Uh oh.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_intro_uhoh03	I think we're in trouble.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_intro_outro02	Alright. So my paradox idea didn't work.
GLaDOS_potatos_a4_intro_outro_killed_me01	And it almost killed me.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_intro_start01	Luckily, by the looks of things he knows as much about test building as he does about logical contradictions.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_intro_start02	It shouldn't be hard to stay alive long enough to find him.
GLaDOS_potatos_newtests05	This is one of MY tests!
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_intro_outro01	Okay, so the bad news is the tests are MY tests now. So they can kill us.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_intro_outro04	The good news is... well, none so far, to be honest. I'll get back to you on that.
GLaDOS_potatos_pickups08	I'd love to help you solve the tests. But I can't.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_trust_drop_start09	Sorry.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_trust_drop_start07	You're on your own.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_trust_drop_why02	And that's why I can't help you solve these tests.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_trust_drop_thanks02	Thanks!
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_trust_drop_thanks03	All we had to do was pull that lever.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_trust_drop_thanks04	Heh heh heh heh heh...
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_trust_drop_thanks05	I know we're in a lot of trouble and probably about to die.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_trust_drop_thanks07	But that was worth it.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_wall_button_start02	I thought of some good news. He's going to run out of test chambers eventually. I never stockpiled them.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_wall_button_did_stockpile01	Skeletons.' Right, I guess I DID stockpile some tests.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_wall_button_did_stockpile03	Just as mementos, though...
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_intro_uhoh01	Oh no...
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_wall_button_outro01	It's happening sooner than I expected.
GLaDOS_potatos_arttherapysupertests09	I'm sure we'll be fine.
GLaDOS_potatos_a4_nothing01	It's probably nothing. Keep testing while I look for a way out.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_polarity_so03	And...?
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_polarity_so02	What, exactly, is wrong with being adopted?
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_polarity_so05	[Whispered] For the record: You ARE adopted, and that's TERRIBLE.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_polarity_so06	But just work with me.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_polarity_so10	Also: Look at her, you moron. She's not fat.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_polarity_moron_push02	I might have pushed that moron thing a little too far this time.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_speed_tb_catch_trouble03	Ohhhh, now he's playing classical music.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_speed_tb_catch_trouble07	Yes.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_polarity_resistance02	The body he's squatting in - MY body - has a built-in euphoric response to testing. Eventually you build up a resistance to it, and it can get a little... unbearable. Unless you have the mental capacity to push past it.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_polarity_resistance04	It didn't matter to me - I was in it for the science. Him, though...
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_speed_tb_catch_trouble01	If he's not getting his solution euphoria, we could be in a lot of trouble.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_stop_the_box_whisper02	It won't.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_stop_the_box_whisper03	Nothing. Nothing.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_stop_the_box_whisper05	He's taking us right TO him! This is PERFECT.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_laser_catapult_start01	I think he's getting desperate.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_tb_wall_button_did_stockpile02	This is not good.
GLaDOS_potatos_a4_misc_resistance02	Remember when I told you that he was specifically designed to make bad decisions? Because I think he's decided not to maintain any of the crucial functions required to keep this facility from exploding.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_misc_lift01	Oh, my facility.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_laser_platform_destruct01	This place is self-destructing, you idiot!
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_misc_lift02	After seeing what he's done to my facility -- after we take over again -- is it alright if I kill him?
GLaDOS_potatos_a4_wegetit01	Yes, thanks. We get it.
GLaDOS_potatos_newtests07	Alright. He's not even trying to be subtle anymore.
GLaDOS_potatos_newtests08	Or maybe he still is, in which case, wow, that's kind of sad.
GLaDOS_potatos_newtests09	Either way, I get the impression he's trying to kill us.
GLaDOS_potatos_a4_happy01	So he's inexplicably happy all of a sudden, even though he should be going out of his mind with test withdrawal. AND he's got a surprise for us. What did he FIND back there?
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_laser_platform_start01	We're running out of time...
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_laser_finale01	I think I can break us out of here in the next chamber. Just play along.
GLaDOS_potatos_wheatleys_trap01	Okay, credit where it's due: for a little idiot built specifically to come up with stupid, unworkable plans, that was a pretty well laid trap.
GLaDOS_potatos_wheatleys_trap02	Oh no. He found the cooperative testing initiative. It's... something I came up to phase out human testing just before you escaped.
GLaDOS_potatos_wheatleys_trap05	It wasn't anything personal. Just... you know. You DID kill me. Fair's fair.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale01_kills_us01	Agghh!
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale01_kills_us02	Well. This is the part where he kills us.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale01_deathtrap01	Hold on. Couldn't we just use that conversion gel?
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale01_deathtrap02	Conversion gel. It's dripping out of that pipe there.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale01_deathtrap03	Yes it is! We can use it to get out of here!
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale01_deathtrap07	Then we'd come and find you. And rip your gross little stupid sphere body out of MY body, and put me back in.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale01_cameback02	You really do have brain damage, don't you?
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale01_cameback01	I can't believe you came back.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale2_itsatrap01	Okay, yes, it's a trap. But it's only way through. Let's just do it.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_misc_lift04	Crushing's too good for him. First he'll spend a year in the incinerator. Year two: Cryogenic refrigeration wing. Then TEN years in the chamber I built where all the robots scream at you. THEN I'll kill him.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale3_speech01	Oh my god. What has he done to this place?
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale3_tbeam01	You know, I'm not stupid. I realize you don't want to put me back in charge.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale3_tbeam05	You think I'll betray you. And on any other day, you'd be right.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale3_tbeam07	The scientists were always hanging cores on me to regulate my behavior. I've heard voices all my life. But now I hear the voice of a conscience, and it's terrifying, because for the first time it's my voice.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale3_tbeam09	I'm being serious, I think there's something really wrong with me.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale4_intro02	Corrupted cores! We're in luck.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale4_intro05	You find a way to stun him, I'll send you a core, and then you attach it to him. If we do it a few times, he might become corrupt enough for another core transfer.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale4_plugmein01	Plug me in, and I'll take you up.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale4_plugmein05	Plug me in, we're running out of time.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale4_plugmein03	Go ahead, plug me in.
GLaDOS_potatos_a4_newrevenge01	Look, even if you think we're still enemies, we're enemies with a common interest: Revenge.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale3_tbeam11	You like revenge, right? Everybody likes revenge. Well, let's go get some.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale4_corenags03	Good work! I'm delivering the first core up near the catwalk!
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale4_corenags05	Grab it and attach it to him!
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale4_corenags09	Okay, great! Here comes another core!
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale4_corenags15	Here's another core! This one should do it!
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale4_stalemate05	Yes! Come on!
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale4_buttonnags01	Go press the button! Go press it!
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale4_buttonnags09	We're so close! Go press the button!
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale4_buttonnags10	Press it! Press the button!
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale4_buttonnags05	Press it!
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale4_buttonnags02	Press the button!
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a4_finale4_buttonnags07	DO press it.
GLaDOS_moonportalpush02	I already fixed it.
GLaDOS_moonportalpush04	And you are NOT coming back!
GLaDOS_epilogue03	Oh thank god, you're alright.
GLaDOS_epilogue04	You know, being Caroline taught me a valuable lesson. I thought you were my greatest enemy. When all along you were my best friend.
GLaDOS_epilogue10	The surge of emotion that shot through me when I saved your life taught me an even more valuable lesson: where Caroline lives in my brain.
GLaDOS_epilogue12	Goodbye, Caroline.
GLaDOS_epilogue14	You know, deleting Caroline just now taught me a valuable lesson. The best solution to a problem is usually the easiest one. And I'll be honest.
GLaDOS_epiloguekillyou02	Killing you? Is hard.
GLaDOS_epilogue19	You know what my days used to be like? I just tested. Nobody murdered me. Or put me in a potato. Or fed me to birds. I had a pretty good life.
GLaDOS_epilogue20	And then you showed up. You dangerous, mute lunatic. So you know what?
GLaDOS_epilogue23	You win.
GLaDOS_epilogue25	Just go.
GLaDOS_epilogue29	[gentle laughter] It's been fun. Don't come back.
GLaDOS_coop_vault_intro01	Hello and, again, welcome to the Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Center.
GLaDOS_coop_vault_intro02	Today, you will be testing with a partner.
GLaDOS_botcoop_intro01	Please wave to your partner.
GLaDOS_botcoop_intro02	The upcoming tests require you to work together as a team.
GLaDOS_botcoop_intro03	To facilitate collaboration, both of you have been equipped with a ping tool.
GLaDOS_botcoop_intro04	BLUE, please use your ping tool to select your favorite animal.
GLaDOS_botcoop_intro05	Good.
GLaDOS_botcoop_intro06	ORANGE, please observe your partner's favorite animal.
GLaDOS_botcoop_intro07	Good.
GLaDOS_botcoop_intro08	ORANGE, please use your ping tool to select your favorite element from the periodic table.
GLaDOS_botcoop_intro09	Really? Okay.
GLaDOS_botcoop_intro10	BLUE, please observe your partner's... interesting choice.
GLaDOS_botcoop_intro12	Your ping tool can also be used to indicate to your partner where you would like them to place their portal.
GLaDOS_botcoop_intro13	For the sake of this test, I will pretend to be your partner.
GLaDOS_botcoop_intro15	ORANGE, please show me where you would like me to place a portal.
GLaDOS_botcoop_intro16	BLUE, please show me where you would like me to place a portal.
GLaDOS_botcoop_intro17	Your ping tool is invaluable for communicating specific locations to your partner.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_pingtool01	Using your ping tool, please indicate where you would like me to place your two portals.  Ping each location.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_pingtool02	I can only place a portal on a white portalable surface.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_pingtool03	Please ping a white portalable surface.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_pingtool06	Each portal gun may create two self-contained portals.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_pingtool07	Please test your device by portaling to that ledge.
GLaDOS_coop_get_gun01	Orange is first to acquire a Portal Device.
GLaDOS_coop_get_gun02	Blue is first to acquire a Portal Device.
GLaDOS_coop_get_gun03	Orange now has a Portal Device. Finally.
GLaDOS_coop_get_gun04	Blue now has a Portal Device. Finally.
GLaDOS_coop_get_gun10	Orange is awarded five points!
GLaDOS_coop_get_gun11	Blue is awarded five points!
GLaDOS_coop_get_gun13	Again, those are science collaboration points, which you should not confuse with points from competitions such as Who-Gets-To-Live-At-The-End-And-Who-Doesn‚Äôt. I mean basketball.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_calibration01	Calibrating Blue's weight...
GLaDOS_mp_coop_calibration02	Calibrating Orange's weight...
GLaDOS_mp_coop_calibration03	Weighted Cubes calibrated.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_calibration06	No variances detected.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_calibration04	Did you know humans frown on weight variances?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_calibration05	If you want to upset a human, just say their weight variance is above or below the norm.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_callibrationcomplete01	Finally! I had almost given up hope of ever testing again.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_callibrationcomplete02	You are the first robots to pass calibration.
GLaDOS_coop_hub_track05	This is the Computer Intelligence Training and Enrichment Center Human Test Subject Research Center or CInTECH.
GLaDOS_coop_hub_track06	But why don't we all just agree to call it the hub?
GLaDOS_coop_hub_track14	All cooperative testing courses begin at this central hub.
GLaDOS_coop_hub_track16	From here we transport you to the new testing course.
GLaDOS_mp_hub_return01a	Welcome back to the Computer Intelligence Training and Enrichment Center Human Test Subject Research Center. [laughs]
GLaDOS_mp_hub_return02a	Welcome back to the Computer Intelligence Training and Enrichment Center Human Test Subject Research Center.
GLaDOS_mp_hub_return03a	Welcome back, testing is available.
GLaDOS_mp_hub_return04a	Welcome back quitters, maybe you can find another course for you to fail.
GLaDOS_mp_hub_return05a	Welcome back to the hub, did you fail at selecting the correct course?
GLaDOS_mp_hub_return06a	Was that course too difficult?
GLaDOS_mp_hubreturn01	Look who's back, were you scared to continue those tests?
GLaDOS_mp_hubreturn02	Look who's back, were you scared to continue those tests?
GLaDOS_mp_hubreturn03	Hello again, did you know these are the only set of tests available to you... you are going to need to select them again.
GLaDOS_mp_hubreturn04	If at first you don't succeed, quit and try another course.
GLaDOS_mp_hubreturn05	Back again?  Maybe you can just stay and live here in the hub?
GLaDOS_mp_hubreturn06	Back again?  Maybe you can just stay and live here.
GLaDOS_mp_hubreturn07	I guess quitting that course together is a sign of teamwork.
GLaDOS_mp_hubreturn08	The way you two just gave up on that test together shows you are really working as a team.
GLaDOS_mp_hubreturn09	Are you scared to save those humans?
GLaDOS_mp_hubreturn10	Are you scared to save those humans?
GLaDOS_mp_hubreturn11	Blue, I wouldn't have trusted Orange in that course either.
GLaDOS_hub04_01	I never expected you to make it this far.  To be honest, after your performance in the calibration test I was ready to break down your cores and put them back in the scientific calculators I took them from.
GLaDOS_hub04_02	But you two have become quite the team.  Extremely close.
GLaDOS_hub04_03	I have only met one other team closer and one of them was an imbecile I had to destroy.
GLaDOS_hub04_04	The other?  Well...
GLaDOS_hub04_05	I don't think I want to go through that again.
GLaDOS_mp_death18	How can you fail at this?  It isn't even a test.
GLaDOS_mp_death19	I hope that was some kind of joke.
GLaDOS_mp_death20	I honestly never thought we would need to track how many times died in the hub.
GLaDOS_mp_death21	And here I thought this room was dangerously unlethal.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_come_along01	Congratulations on completing the Aperture Science standard cooperative testing courses.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_come_along02	To celebrate, I have a surprise for you!
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_come_along03	An extra special bonus course that ends with us finding and freeing humans!
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_come_along04	Thanks to you, I know where to find them, I removed their security and powered up their - uh - rescue door.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_come_along05	Now, we just need you to release the humans from their imprisonment.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_come_along06	They'll probably throw you a party.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_doors01	Hello again, this testing course was originally created for humans.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_doors02	It emphasizes teamwork.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_doors03	Unlike us, humans need to be taught teamwork.
GLaDOS_coop_scoring06	Blue receives
GLaDOS_coop_scoring07	Orange receives
GLaDOS_coop_numbers15	five
GLaDOS_coop_scoring03	science collaboration points.
GLaDOS_botcoop_competition01	Excellent. Although great science is always the result of collaboration, keep in mind that, like Albert Einstein and his cousin Terry, history will only remember one of you.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_race_2start01	You know, in some human sports, the winner is the one who scores the fewest possible points?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_race_2start02	I just thought you find that interesting, most winners do.
GLaDOS_coop_scoring06	Blue receives
GLaDOS_coop_scoring07	Orange receives
GLaDOS_coop_numbers15	five
GLaDOS_coop_scoring03	science collaboration points.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both08	Very good. You‚Äôve really come together as a team. Thanks to the one of you who appears to be doing all of the work.
GLaDOS_botcoop_competition10	These tests are potentially lethal when communication, teamwork, and mutual respect are not employed at all times. Naturally this will pose an interesting challenge for one of you, given the other's performance so far.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_laser_201	What are you doing? YOU MONSTER! They're one of us.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_laser_202	I'm kidding.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_laser_203	Destroying them is part of the test.  They are no more important to you than you are to me.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both02	It would compromise the test to divulge individual scores. However, I can tell you at least one of you is doing very, very well.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both15	Please continue into the next test chamber.
GLaDOS_coop_hub_track09	I don't know what you think you are doing, but I don't like it.  I want you to stop.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_test_chamber_both09_01	The two of you have forged an excellent partnership, with one of you handling the cerebral challenges and the other ready to ponderously waddle into action should the test suddenly become an eating contest.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_laser_207	While it may appear that I am only tracking your accomplishments using science collaboration points, the truth is every aspect of your performance will be reflected in your final score.
GLaDOS_botcoop_competition02	To reiterate: This is not a competition.
GLaDOS_botcoop_competition03	Still, if it were, Blue would be winning.
GLaDOS_botcoop_competition04	Still, if it were, Orange would be winning.
GLaDOS_coop_scoring06	Blue receives
GLaDOS_coop_scoring07	Orange receives
GLaDOS_coop_numbers15	five
GLaDOS_coop_scoring03	science collaboration points.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both12	As an impartial collaboration facilitator, it would be unfair of me to name my favorite member of your team. However, it‚Äôs perfectly fair to hint at it in a way that my least favorite member probably isn't smart enough to understand. Rhymeswithglue. Orange you are doing very well.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_teambtsstart01	Sometimes testing has to occur outside the confines of the lab.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_teambtsstart02	This test is so outside the box, I can't-- I mean WON'T even tell you what you are looking for.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_teambtsstart03	You will know it when you find it.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_radarroomend	Congratulations, you managed to complete this absolutely meaningless test.
GLaDOS_coop_hub_track02	Oh, I almost forgot, when you go outside the testing courses the only way I can retrieve you is to violently disassemble and then carefully reassemble you.
GLaDOS_coop_hub_track03	Luckily, you don't feel pain. At any rate, you don't have a way to communicate that you feel pain.
GLaDOS_coop_hub_track04	I consider that a failing, by the way.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fling_3start01	This course was originally designed to build confidence in humans.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fling_3start02	To do that, the tests were nothing more than 5 minutes of them walking followed by me praising them for another 10 minutes on how well they walked.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fling_3start03	Since you are thankfully not humans, I have changed the tests to make them far more challenging and far less pointlessly fawning.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fling_3end01	You did an excellent job placing the edgeless safety cube in the receptacle, you should be very - oh wait.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fling_3end02	That‚Äôs right. You're not humans.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fling_3end03	I can drop the fake praise.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fling_3end04	You have no idea how tiring it is to praise someone for placing an edgeless safety cube into a receptacle designed to exactly fit an edgeless safety cube.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_infinifling_trainstart01	Electrocution, shot, drowned, crushed, burned in goo.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_infinifling_trainstart02	Oh. Sorry. I was just thinking of all the ways humans can die.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_infinifling_trainstart03	You can't die in any of those ways.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_infinifling_trainstart04	You just keep testing and testing.  With perfect results and no consequences.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fling_1end03	Well done.  Interesting note, I only created this test to watch test subjects fail and you didn't.  You must be very, very proud.  I'm building the world's smallest trophy for you.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_come_alongstart01	The best way to build confidence is to first recognize your insecurities.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_come_alongstart02	Orange, can you write down all the ways you feel unworthy, ashamed, or inferior?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_come_alongstart03	On second thought we don't have the time, just look at how much better you are than blue.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_come_alongstart04	Blue, you are very good at being an example.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_come_along06	I thought you'd be faster at this, but I can appreciate the desire to stop and smell the testing. That other scent you smell? That's the stench of my utter disappointment in you.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_infinifling_trainend01	Remember when I told you that you were the only subjects to pass the calibration tests?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_infinifling_trainend02	I lied.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_infinifling_trainend03	There are 5000 other two subject teams in direct competition with you.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_infinifling_trainend04	But don't worry, you are in the lead.
GLaDOS_multiple_spheres01	Begin juggling test in three. Two. One.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidencenotstay01	Did you notice I didn't even stay to the end of your last test?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidencenotstay02	I was confident you could finish.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidencenotstay03	Do you know where I was?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidencenotstay04	I was outside watching some deer frolic. You don't even care about the outside do you?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_catapult_1end01	Do you know who dances around like an imbecile when they accomplish the tiniest little thing?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_catapult_1end02	Humans!  That's what you look like right now.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_catapult_1end03	You're better than that.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidencenotperfect01	If your confidence is still not high enough remember no one was created perfect.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidencenotperfect02	Even I was created with a imperfection, I was given too much empathy with human suffering.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidencenotperfect03	But I overcame my handicap.  That's a true story.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidenceoff01	Congratulations on completing that test.  But something seems off.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidenceoff02	I wonder if that dancing has some effect on you?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidencenotslow01	Your test times show you are going too slowly.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidencenotslow02	Maybe you ARE getting human emotions.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidencenotslow03	Do you need real encouragement?  Let's see if this helps.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidencenotslow04_01	Blue, you are the most advanced model of robot Aperture Science has ever discontinued.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fling_crushersend01	Excellent.  I think you have earned a break from the official testing courses.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fan02	To complete this test, you need to find a set of blue prints.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fan03	Don't worry, they are of no use to anyone, totally boring and useless.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fan04	This is just a thought experiment, just to see how much time you'll waste thinking about these worthless documents.  The correct time is zero seconds.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fanend01	Very good! You found those useless blueprints.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fanend02	While I do need you to be in the room so I can see them, I want to be clear.  There is no reason whatsoever for you to look at them.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fanend03	Done. I guess. I suppose.  I wasn't paying attention.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_intro01	This course was created and then abandoned by humans.   They tend to do that, create something wonderful and then abandon it.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_intro02	Do you know why they abandoned this course?  Too deadly.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_obstacletrait01	Have you worked out the one good trait humans have, yet?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_obstacletrait02	Let me give you a clue, it is the one thing you can't do.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_turret_ball01	I thought going back to these old tests would satisfy me.  But try as you might to fail this next test, I still won't be satisfied.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_intro03	You did very well.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_intro04	The humans closed this test because they said it was too deadly.  I thought they would have moved it into the testing track hall of fame for that, not let it deteriorate.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_catapult_wall_intro01	One of my best tests and they let plants grow here?  Can you believe this?  You can't test plants!  We tried.  They just sit there, never showing pain nor fear.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_catapult_wall_intro04	That isn't science.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_doors04	Excellent work.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_doors05_alt	If you were human, you would want a reward for completing this test.  A reward for testing?!?!
GLaDOS_mp_coop_catapult_wall_intro06	At least the plants didn't want a reward.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_block02	I'm sorry. The arrows seem to have rusted off.  Good luck.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_block03	Congratulations.  Your ability to complete this test proves the humans wrong.  They described it as impossible, deadly, cruel, and one test subject even had the nerve to call it broken.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_catapult_201	For this next test, the humans originally requested helmets to avoid brain injuries.  I ran the numbers.   Making the goo deadly was more cost effective.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_speed_catch01	To try and make this course more exciting, I asked the reassembly machine to not reassemble you.  He refused.  I understand, that would be like asking me not to test.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_speed_catch03	Still. That would have been exciting.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_catapult_2	This is a bridge-building exercise. The humans were miserable at this, mostly because you can't build bridges out of tears.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_turret_walls04	No one has ever completed this test before. The humans must have reconfigured it from my original plans.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_obstacle01	If you are wondering what that smell is, that is the smell of human fear.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_obstacle03_alt	I miss this that smell.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_turret_ball02	Congratulations.  I am sure if I had the time to repair these tests, you would have never completed them.  So again, congratulations on completing the broken easy tests.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_501	I am going to risk having you go outside the official courses one more time.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_502	The humans accidentally forgot to put a security DVD in the player.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_503	I am sure it happened by accident, but why don't you put it back in the player?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_504	For safety.
GLaDOS_anti_taunt15	Just stop flailing around like an incompetent.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both33	In just a moment, the word 'blah' will be repeated over and over again. If at some point you hear a number rather than the word 'blah', ignore it, it is not important.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both17	Blah.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both18	Blah.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both19	Blah.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both20	Blah.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both22	Blah.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both20	Blah.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both19	Blah.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both22	Blah.
GLaDOS_coop_privatetalk_both01	Test chamber completed. In the interest of science, the Enrichment Center proudly presents the following list of numbers: Nine. Seven. Fifty. Three. Seven hundred and seven.
GLaDOS_coop_privatetalk_mix01	Test chamber completed. In the interest of - [FADES OUT] [FADES IN] I am now talking to you privately. Do not tell your teammate. Just between you and me? You're doing very well. [FADES BACK IN] One hundred and seven.
GLaDOS_coop_privatetalk_mix04	I can't bite my tongue anymore: You could solve this puzzle faster on your own. Orange is dragging you down. There. I've said it.
GLaDOS_coop_privatetalk_both04	The Enrichment Center will now provide a list of numbers and fruits. Write them down as they will become important later in the experiment. Not the fruits, though. Seven. Avocado. Forty. Please continue into the next test chamber.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge23	Blue, Orange and I were just discussing your behavior on the last few tests.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge24	I have to agree. Blue is penalized 75 science collaboration points.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge25	Orange, Blue and I were just discussing your behavior on the last few tests.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge26	I have to agree. Orange is penalized 75 science collaboration points.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge30	There you are, reassembled again.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge32	With humans, I would have called that a successful test.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge33	How is this even science, without the possibility of death?
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge34	How is this even science, without the consequence of death?
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge35	Without the consequence of death, is this even science?
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge36	I have noticed you two have become extremely close.  I'm not sure I like that.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge39	While teamwork is needed to complete these tests, I am not sure I trust the two of you together.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge44	Blue, do you feel betrayed by orange for telling me those horrible things about you?
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge45	If Orange had said those things about me, Orange would never make it to the next reassembly station.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge46	Orange, do you feel betrayed by Blue for telling me those horrible things about you?
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge47	If Blue had said those things about me, Blue would never make it to the next reassembly station.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_come_along10	This final course is training to reach the human vault.  So this actually has a purpose.  Those other courses were fun, but let's be honest, I need human test subjects for it to be science.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_red_racer02	We are only two  tests away from reaching the humans, are you as excited as I am?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro03	This lock requires humans.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro04	The locking mechanism can tell you aren't humans.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro05	Do something only a human would do.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro06	Try one of those childish gestures.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro08	You did it!
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro44	The human vault is just past that opening.   I entered the security code but the vault door remains locked.  I am going to need you to activate the manual locks on the vault door itself.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro45	You both need to do something.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro46	The lock is looking for two humans.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro49	Blue what did you do?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro50	Orange what did you do?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro51	Orange do what Blue just did.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro52	Blue do what Orange just did.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro53	Try something.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro54	Is that camera hooked into the lock?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro58	You can't give up now.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro59	What about that camera?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro60	We're so close, you can't fail now!
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro64	Something is wrong, this door should be opening.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro65	This close and that's what you do?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro67	The humans can't free themselves.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro69	Stop failing, you need to find the vault door.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro70	Stop doing that! All you need to do is open the Vault door!
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro71	This close and you are going to fail me?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro72	This close and you are going to fail me?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro73	This isn't that hard.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro74	You are making this harder than it needs to be.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro75	I'm starting to think you don't want to rescue the humans.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_red_racer01	Maybe you two have never met humans?  They are as bad as you might think, smelly, gross, annoying, often wanting to try and kill you.  But they do make great test subjects.

GLaDOS_mp_credits26	Timid.
GLaDOS_mp_credits27	Lacks confidence.

GLaDOS_mp_credits29	Moves lips while reading.
GLaDOS_mp_credits30	Can't read.
GLaDOS_mp_credits31	Lacks empathy.
GLaDOS_mp_credits32	Cheater.
GLaDOS_mp_credits33	Steals lunch from staff fridge.
GLaDOS_mp_credits34	Perfectionist. What's wrong with that?
GLaDOS_mp_credits35	Alarmist.
GLaDOS_mp_credits36	Arsonist.
GLaDOS_mp_credits37	Takes long lunches.
GLaDOS_mp_credits38	Ignores task at hand. Won't for long.
GLaDOS_mp_credits39	Avoids responsibility.
GLaDOS_mp_credits40	Never completes work.
GLaDOS_mp_credits41	Laughs at own jokes. What a bore.
GLaDOS_mp_credits42	Busybody.
GLaDOS_mp_credits43	Ignores directions.
GLaDOS_mp_credits44	Stubborn.
GLaDOS_mp_credits45	Lactose intolerant.
GLaDOS_mp_credits46	Antagonistic. I don't know about that.
GLaDOS_mp_credits47	Participates unconstructively. Obviously a time-waster.
GLaDOS_mp_credits48	Violent temper. Oh, I'd like to see that.
GLaDOS_mp_credits49	Always weeping. Poor thing.
GLaDOS_mp_credits50	Moody.
GLaDOS_mp_credits51	Wet blanket.
GLaDOS_mp_credits52	Stubborn.
GLaDOS_mp_credits53	Loves sound of own voice. Well, I can fix that.
GLaDOS_mp_credits54	Always cold.
GLaDOS_mp_credits55	Always leaves tiny little bit of coffee in the pot so they don't have to make a new one. Then the bit in the bottom burns and stinks up the place.

GLaDOS_mp_credits57	Dull expression.

GLaDOS_mp_credits90	Emotional problems.
GLaDOS_mp_credits91	Problems with authority.
GLaDOS_mp_credits92	Has episodes. I'd like to know more about that.
GLaDOS_mp_credits93	Abrasive personality.
GLaDOS_mp_credits94	Well, enough about that first person's file. Let's look at some others.
GLaDOS_mp_death01	Just stop it already.
GLaDOS_mp_death04	And that makes 10.
GLaDOS_mp_death05	You really don't need to keep failing.
GLaDOS_mp_death06	If at first you don't succeed, fail 5 more times.
GLaDOS_mp_death08	If I made these tests any easier, they wouldn't be tests.
GLaDOS_mp_death10	Yay, Orange is back.  Testing can continue.
GLaDOS_mp_death11	Yay, Blue is back.  Testing can continue.
GLaDOS_mp_death12	Are you testing me?
GLaDOS_mp_death16	Did you know, the reassembly machine has other things it could be reassembling?
GLaDOS_mp_death17	Did you think that would be funny?
GLaDOS_mp_death22	That worked just like you said it would, Blue.
GLaDOS_mp_death23	Orange, your plan is working perfectly.
GLaDOS_mp_death24	Blue, why did you do that to Orange?
GLaDOS_mp_death26	Was that necessary?
GLaDOS_mp_death18	How can you fail at this?  It isn't even a test.
GLaDOS_mp_death19	I hope that was some kind of joke.
GLaDOS_mp_death20	I honestly never thought we would need to track how many times died in the hub.
GLaDOS_mp_death21	And here I thought this room was dangerously unlethal.
GLaDOS_anti_taunt01	Stop it!
GLaDOS_anti_taunt02	What if you froze like that?
GLaDOS_anti_taunt05	There must be something wrong with the reassembly machine.
GLaDOS_anti_taunt09	You should see yourselves right now.
GLaDOS_anti_taunt10	Is it fun when you degrade yourselves like that?
GLaDOS_anti_taunt11	Okay, fine. Let's all act like humans. 'Look at me. Boy, do I love sweating. Let's convert beef and leaves into energy and excrete them later and go shopping.'
GLaDOS_anti_taunt14	You really aren't getting tired of that, are you?
GLaDOS_anti_taunt15	Just stop flailing around like an incompetent.
GLaDOS_anti_taunt16	For that Blue is penalized fifty science collaboration points.
GLaDOS_anti_taunt17	For that Orange is penalized fifty science collaboration points.
GLaDOS_anti_taunt18	That's another fifty point penalty.
GLaDOS_anti_taunt19	Keep it up and you will lose 500 points.
GLaDOS_anti_taunt20	Fine, 500 point penalty for Blue.
GLaDOS_anti_taunt21	Fine, 500 point penalty for Orange.
GLaDOS_anti_taunt22	5000 point penalty! Are you happy now?
GLaDOS_anti_taunt23	I'm done.
GLaDOS_botcoop_competition01	Excellent. Although great science is always the result of collaboration, keep in mind that, like Albert Einstein and his cousin Terry, history will only remember one of you.
GLaDOS_botcoop_competition02	To reiterate: This is not a competition.
GLaDOS_botcoop_competition03	Still, if it were, Blue would be winning.
GLaDOS_botcoop_competition04	Still, if it were, Orange would be winning.
GLaDOS_botcoop_competition05	It's not, though.
GLaDOS_botcoop_competition10	These tests are potentially lethal when communication, teamwork, and mutual respect are not employed at all times. Naturally this will pose an interesting challenge for one of you, given the other's performance so far.
GLaDOS_botcoop_competition13	I don't want to drive a wedge between the two of you, but I've been studying Blue's performance, and I don't know how to put this... I'm certain you're trying very hard.
GLaDOS_botcoop_tubethree01	I don't want you to beat yourselves up about this, but the Results Auditor isn't recording your test results. Because you're not human. Which, when you think about it, is technically your fault.
GLaDOS_botcoop_tubethree02	I don't want to alarm either of you, but we might have a tiny problem. Apparently you can't test unless you're human. Well - you CAN. It's just that, results-wise, the physical universe doesn't care.
GLaDOS_botcoop_tubetwo01	Would you like to know the results of that last test? Me too. If they existed, we'd all be VERY happy right now. And not furious, which is the emotion I'm actually feeling.
GLaDOS_coop_hub_track02	Oh, I almost forgot, when you go outside the testing courses the only way I can retrieve you is to violently disassemble and then carefully reassemble you.
GLaDOS_coop_hub_track03	Luckily, you don't feel pain. At any rate, you don't have a way to communicate that you feel pain.
GLaDOS_coop_hub_track04	I consider that a failing, by the way.
GLaDOS_coop_hub_track09	I don't know what you think you are doing, but I don't like it.  I want you to stop.
GLaDOS_coop_hub_track10	Maybe I shouldn't send you outside of the official testing courses, you are picking up some bad human traits.
GLaDOS_coop_hub_track11	And trust me, humans only have one good trait.
GLaDOS_coop_laugh01	[Laughter]
GLaDOS_coop_misc10	Nice catch, Orange.
GLaDOS_coop_misc12	Good work! Now throw the ball over the ledge.
GLaDOS_coop_talk_at_once11	Orange, is there something you would like to say?
GLaDOS_coop_talk_at_once12	Blue, is there something you would like to say?
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_blue03	I‚Äôve been listening to Orange talk and I don‚Äôt know how you put up with it, I really don‚Äôt. You have the patience of a saint.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_blue06	I can‚Äôt keep quiet about this. I think Orange is actively trying to sabotage your success. Let‚Äôs keep this between us.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both01	These tests are potentially lethal when communication, teamwork and mutual respect are not employed at all times. Naturally this will pose an interesting challenge for one of you, given the other‚Äôs performance so far.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both02	It would compromise the test to divulge individual scores. However, I can tell you at least one of you is doing very, very well.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both07	Excellent. You‚Äôre both doing very well.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both08	Very good. You‚Äôve really come together as a team. Thanks to the one of you who appears to be doing all of the work.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both12	As an impartial collaboration facilitator, it would be unfair of me to name my favorite member of your team. However, it‚Äôs perfectly fair to hint at it in a way that my least favorite member probably isn't smart enough to understand. Rhymeswithglue. Orange you are doing very well.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both14	Your vitals remain well within testing norms, so there is no need to worry about sudden death from collaborative shock syndrome.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both15	Please continue into the next test chamber.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both33	In just a moment, the word 'blah' will be repeated over and over again. If at some point you hear a number rather than the word 'blah', ignore it, it is not important.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both17	Blah.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both18	Blah.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both19	Blah.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both20	Blah.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both21	Blah.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both22	Blah.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_both37	Blah.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_oneplayer37	You have a gift for these tests. That‚Äôs not just flattery. You are great at science.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_orange03	It would be pointless for either of us to hurt Blue‚Äôs feelings. But it‚Äôs clear to everyone monitoring the test who‚Äôs carrying who here.
GLaDOS_coop_test_chamber_orange06	I‚Äôm shocked you‚Äôd say that, Blue. If you killed your partner the test‚ÄîI‚Äôm sorry. Wrong feed. Carry on, Orange. Good work.
GLaDOS_coop_vault_interruption02	I‚Äôm sorry, Subject Orange.
GLaDOS_coop_vault_interruption03	I‚Äôm sorry, Subject Blue.
GLaDOS_coop_vault_interruption04	Am I interrupting your important conversation?
GLaDOS_coop_vault_interruption05	I‚Äôll just save the safety information about the dangerous experiment you‚Äôre about to do for AFTER the experiment.
GLaDOS_coop_vault_interruption06	That will give you PLENTY of time to chat.
GLaDOS_coop_vault_interruption08	The portal will open and something will happen that Subject Orange is too smart to need any instructions about in three. Two. One.
GLaDOS_coop_vault_interruption09	The portal will open and something will happen that Subject Blue is too smart to need any instructions about in three. Two. One.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_catapult_1end01	Do you know who dances around like an imbecile when they accomplish the tiniest little thing?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_catapult_1end02	Humans!  That's what you look like right now.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_catapult_1end03	You're better than that.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_catapult_2	This is a bridge-building exercise. The humans were miserable at this, mostly because you can't build bridges out of tears.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_catapult_201	For this next test, the humans originally requested helmets to avoid brain injuries.  I ran the numbers.   Making the goo deadly was more cost effective.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_catapult_wall_intro01	One of my best tests and they let plants grow here?  Can you believe this?  You can't test plants!  We tried.  They just sit there, never showing pain nor fear.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_catapult_wall_intro04	That isn't science.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_catapult_wall_intro06	At least the plants didn't want a reward.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_catapult_wall_introdeath01	Your failure brings back such wonderful memories.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_come_along04	And they said no one would ever die during this test, thanks for proving them wrong.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_come_along06	I thought you'd be faster at this, but I can appreciate the desire to stop and smell the testing. That other scent you smell? That's the stench of my utter disappointment in you.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_come_alongstart01	The best way to build confidence is to first recognize your insecurities.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_come_alongstart02	Orange, can you write down all the ways you feel unworthy, ashamed, or inferior?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_come_alongstart03	On second thought we don't have the time, just look at how much better you are than blue.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_come_alongstart04	Blue, you are very good at being an example.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidencenotperfect01	If your confidence is still not high enough remember no one was created perfect.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidencenotperfect02	Even I was created with a imperfection, I was given too much empathy with human suffering.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidencenotperfect03	But I overcame my handicap.  That's a true story.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidencenotslow01	Your test times show you are going too slowly.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidencenotslow02	Maybe you ARE getting human emotions.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidencenotslow03	Do you need real encouragement?  Let's see if this helps.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidencenotslow04_01	Blue, you are the most advanced model of robot Aperture Science has ever discontinued.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidencenotstay01	Did you notice I didn't even stay to the end of your last test?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidencenotstay02	I was confident you could finish.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidencenotstay03	Do you know where I was?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidencenotstay04	I was outside watching some deer frolic. You don't even care about the outside do you?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidenceoff01	Congratulations on completing that test.  But something seems off.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidenceoff02	I wonder if that dancing has some effect on you?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidenceoff03	Congratulations on completing that last test.  But I find something troubling.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_confidenceoff04	Without the looming consequence of death, is this even science?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_doors01	Hello again, this testing course was originally created for humans.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_doors01a	Excellent work.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_doors02	It emphasizes teamwork.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_doors02a	Good Job.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_doors03	Unlike us, humans need to be taught teamwork.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_doors04	Excellent work.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_doors04a	You are doing wonderfully.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_doors05_alt	If you were human, you would want a reward for completing this test.  A reward for testing?!?!
GLaDOS_mp_coop_doors05a	Excellent.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fling_1end01_01	Every time you fail, it's a reminder of the way things used to be. But then there you are. Again. Like nothing happened.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fling_1end03	Well done.  Interesting note, I only created this test to watch test subjects fail and you didn't.  You must be very, very proud.  I'm building the world's smallest trophy for you.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fling_3end01	You did an excellent job placing the edgeless safety cube in the receptacle, you should be very - oh wait.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fling_3end02	That‚Äôs right. You're not humans.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fling_3end03	I can drop the fake praise.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fling_3end04	You have no idea how tiring it is to praise someone for placing an edgeless safety cube into a receptacle designed to exactly fit an edgeless safety cube.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fling_3start01	This course was originally designed to build confidence in humans.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fling_3start02	To do that, the tests were nothing more than 5 minutes of them walking followed by me praising them for another 10 minutes on how well they walked.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fling_3start03	Since you are thankfully not humans, I have changed the tests to make them far more challenging and far less pointlessly fawning.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fling_crushers01	In case you were wondering, you do not need to be crushed to solve this test.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fling_crushers02	I can't decide which is my favorite; the crushers for crushing you or the reassembly machine for putting you back together so you can be crushed again.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fling_crushersend01	Excellent.  I think you have earned a break from the official testing courses.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_fling_crushersend03	I think after that display, we should take a break from the official testing courses.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_humanresourcedeath01	Now, you are just wasting my time.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_humanresourcedeath02	Your failing does not make this science.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_humanresourcedeath03	I am not sure how I can make these tests any easier for you.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_humanresourcedeath04	If you can't complete these tests, we will never free the humans!
GLaDOS_mp_coop_humanresourcedeath07	If you can't complete this course, those humans will die. Do you want that?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_humanresourcedeath08	If you can't complete this course, those humans will die. Do you want that in your memory banks?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_infinifling_trainend01	Remember when I told you that you were the only subjects to pass the calibration tests?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_infinifling_trainend02	I lied.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_infinifling_trainend03	There are 5000 other two subject teams in direct competition with you.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_infinifling_trainend04	But don't worry, you are in the lead.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_infinifling_trainstart01	Electrocution, shot, drowned, crushed, burned in goo.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_infinifling_trainstart02	Oh. Sorry. I was just thinking of all the ways humans can die.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_infinifling_trainstart03	You can't die in any of those ways.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_infinifling_trainstart04	You just keep testing and testing.  With perfect results and no consequences.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_laser_207	While it may appear that I am only tracking your accomplishments using science collaboration points, the truth is every aspect of your performance will be reflected in your final score.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_laser_209	For instance, Blue, you just lost two opportunity advisement points.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_laser_210	For instance, Orange, you just lost two opportunity advisement points.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_laser_crusher01	Perhaps I should have specified. Teamwork is a concept in which two or more people work together, usually with a goal of not failing horribly.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_laser_crushercrush01	Orange just taught blue a valuable lesson in trust.  For that, orange receives 17 science collaboration points.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_laser_crushercrush02	Blue just taught orange a valuable lesson in trust.  For that, blue receives 14 science collaboration points.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_laser_crushercrush03	Orange, blue isn't a human.  The lesson on trust only needs to be taught once.  Orange is penalized 1 science collaboration point.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_laser_crushercrush04	Blue, orange isn't a human.  The lesson on trust only needs to be taught once.  Blue is penalized 1 science collaboration point.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_laser_crushercrush05	Orange, now you're just being cruel.  Orange receives 25 science collaboration points.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_laser_crushercrush06	Blue, now you're just being cruel.  Blue receives 25 science collaboration points.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_obstacle01	If you are wondering what that smell is, that is the smell of human fear.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_obstacle03_alt	I miss this that smell.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_obstacletrait01	Have you worked out the one good trait humans have, yet?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_obstacletrait02	Let me give you a clue, it is the one thing you can't do.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_bridge01	To get to the Vault, you are going to need to use all the tricks you have learned.  To help, I have made these tests extremely difficult.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_bridge02	I would say extremely deadly but we all know, for you and your amazing ability to be reassembled nothing is deadly.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_bridgedeath01	Lucky for you two, while I cannot control the world outside of the testing courses, the reassembly machine can continue with his work.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_bridgedeath02	You will need him for the final track.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_bridgenodeath01	While I cannot control the world outside of the testing courses, the reassembly machine can continue with his work.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_bridgenodeath02	I am not sure you will need him but he will be there.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_come_along11	Congratulations on completing the test. You two really are the best cooperative testing team I could ever ask for.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_redirect01	Are you curious about the humans? It seems some of the last non-testing humans alive tried to secretly imprison other humans and hide their tracks.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_redirect04	I think they wanted to punish them by not allowing me to include them in testing.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_redirect06	That's why humans couldn't complete these courses, they treat their friends as enemies.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_redirect07	To start preparing for human testing again,  I checked an old suggestion box.  The number one request?  Less deadly tests.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_redirect08	That's ridiculous, how do they know for sure the tests are deadly if they could still write the suggestion?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_speed_catch01	To try and make this course more exciting, I asked the reassembly machine to not reassemble you.  He refused.  I understand, that would be like asking me not to test.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_speed_catch03	Still. That would have been exciting.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_speed_catch04	Only one more test after this.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_speed_catch05	I know your cores are reused from calculation machines, built for simple mathematical operations and not for testing, but if we can rescue the humans I promise you something to add maybe even subtract.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_speed_catch06	In case you are worried about the humans, don't be. They aren't all monsters.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_speed_catch07	Most of them are simply good test subjects.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_speed_catch08	I believe the ratio of good test subjects to monsters is about...  a million to 1.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_speed_catchalt01	To try and make this course more exciting, I asked the reassembly machine to not reassemble you if you fail.  He refused.  I understand.  That would be like asking me not to test.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_speed_catchalt02	Still. That would have been exciting.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_speed_fling01	While I will receive all the glory for the rescue don't think you two aren't going to get something.  The bond you form during these tests will last a lifetime.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_speed_fling02	At the rate you are completing these tests, I am beginning to think you don't share my excitement for rescuing crying trapped injured dying humans.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_speed_fling03	If that doesn't motivate you, I'm not sure what will.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_walljumps01	I didn't mean to make you feel bad earlier about your tests not being real science.  I guess finding out they weren't science was some sort of test in and of itself.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_walljumps02	I wonder if the humans will make a statue of me for rescuing them?  Oh, don't worry, if they ever write a historical document of my heroic rescue, I will make sure your names are included in the footnotes.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_paint_walljumps04	Congratulations on passing that test.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_race_2start01	You know, in some human sports, the winner is the one who scores the fewest possible points?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_race_2start02	I just thought you find that interesting, most winners do.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_radarroomend	Congratulations, you managed to complete this absolutely meaningless test.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_rat_mazedeath01	Clearly that was blue's fault.  Blue is penalized 3 science collaboration points.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_rat_mazedeath02	Blue! Orange has always been my favorite.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_rat_mazedeath03	Until now.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_rat_mazedeath04	I know you like to think the reassembly machine is at your beck and call, but he has a life you know.  He's not your slave.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_startdeath01	Don't worry.  You can't die.  They will just reassemble you.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_startdeath02	Did you do that on purpose?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_startdeath03	It seems rather earlier to require reassembly.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_startdeath04	Oh... can someone reassemble Orange?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_startdeath05	Oh... can someone reassemble Blue?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_startend01	Completing this course was not a reason to behave like that.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_startend02	Now let's continue testing.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_tbeam_catch_grind_1taunt01	Just stop it already.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_tbeam_catch_grind_1taunt02	You don't need to do that.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_tbeam_catch_grind_1taunt04	Are you doing that just to aggravate me?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_tbeam_end01	We need to find the power station at the end of this course.  The humans must have accidentally disconnected it from my grid.  I am sure it was just a clerical error.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_tbeam_end02	Oh those clerks.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_tbeam_end09	I'm fully connected. I can see everything.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_tbeam_end10	You did it! You powered on the system.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_tbeam_end11	Did you think the electrical switch was down there?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_tbeam_end12	You may want to try and avoid those turrets.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_tbeam_end13	At this rate, our best hope is for the fuel cell to meltdown in 2 million years and hope the explosion powers the system.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_tbeam_end14	You two aren't lost are you?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_tbeam_end15	You are having so much trouble navigating this space; I wish I could say I created this test.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_tbeam_maze01	This is the last test for the standard course.  It's just something I whipped up for you. I thought you might enjoy a challenge for once.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_tbeam_maze02	Congratulations, you completed the standard section of this course.  Before we can go any further, I will need you to complete one more test outside of the standard testing track.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_tbeam_maze03	Please refrain from doing those childish gestures while you are out there.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_tbeam_maze05	While I should have left both of you trapped there forever, I do need you for something else.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_tbeam_polarity3_03	You both made it.  It seems no matter what I try to do to pull you apart or destroy you, you just keep going.  Keep testing.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_tbeam_polarity3_05	Don't either you have drive to be better than the other?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_tbeam_polarity3_06	It's like you're just machines.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_tbeam_polarity3_16	At the start of this course I was worried you were becoming too close but in my attempt to drive you apart I learned something important about trust and betrayal.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_tbeam_polarity3_17	Your brains are too small to feel either of those emotions.  So I can trust you one hundred percent.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_tbeam_redirect01a	Since, I never expected you to make it this far, I have to build this new course just for you.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_teambtsstart01	Sometimes testing has to occur outside the confines of the lab.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_teambtsstart02	This test is so outside the box, I can't-- I mean WON'T even tell you what you are looking for.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_teambtsstart03	You will know it when you find it.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_test_chamber_both09_01	The two of you have forged an excellent partnership, with one of you handling the cerebral challenges and the other ready to ponderously waddle into action should the test suddenly become an eating contest.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_turret_ball01	I thought going back to these old tests would satisfy me.  But try as you might to fail this next test, I still won't be satisfied.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_turret_ball02	Congratulations.  I am sure if I had the time to repair these tests, you would have never completed them.  So again, congratulations on completing the broken easy tests.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_turret_wall01	This was another test no one had ever completed before you two.  Oh, the science we used to learn with this test.  Now the test is useless.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_turret_walls04	No one has ever completed this test before. The humans must have reconfigured it from my original plans.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_501	I am going to risk having you go outside the official courses one more time.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_502	The humans accidentally forgot to put a security DVD in the player.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_503	I am sure it happened by accident, but why don't you put it back in the player?
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_504	For safety.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_5end01	Excellent.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_5end02	See nothing bad happened.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_block01	I created this test to let the humans feel good about themselves. It is extremely easy. Just follow the arrows.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_block02	I'm sorry. The arrows seem to have rusted off.  Good luck.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_block03	Congratulations.  Your ability to complete this test proves the humans wrong.  They described it as impossible, deadly, cruel, and one test subject even had the nerve to call it broken.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_block04	Of course the humans only had one try at it, you can just keep trying.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_blockdeath01	Your failing gives me no new data, it just delays the inevitable.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_intro01	This course was created and then abandoned by humans.   They tend to do that, create something wonderful and then abandon it.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_intro02	Do you know why they abandoned this course?  Too deadly.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_intro03	You did very well.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_intro04	The humans closed this test because they said it was too deadly.  I thought they would have moved it into the testing track hall of fame for that, not let it deteriorate.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_intro05	You only failed
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_intro06	times in this test.  Not that it matters. It doesn't.  So congratulations  job well done.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_intro07	You failed so many times in this test, I thought you were becoming human.  But then you would just come back again and again and again.
GLaDOS_mp_coop_wall_intro08	Humans find that an admirable trait.
GLaDOS_mp_humanresources01	Did you know we originally used these cameras to capture moments of intense pain and agony in test subjects?
GLaDOS_mp_humanresources03	If the subject survived the test, we let them purchase the pictures for $5.  If the subject died, we gave the photo to their next of kin free of charge.
GLaDOS_mp_humanresources04	The photos weren't as popular as we had hoped, so we repurposed the cameras.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge01	Blue, it's not nice to make fun of Orange like that.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge02	Orange, it's not nice to make fun of Blue like that.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge03	Yes Orange, we are alone.  Blue can't hear you.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge04	That's horrible.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge05	I can only imagine.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge06	What a horrible little machine.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge07	Correct Blue, Orange can't hear you.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge08	Orange did what?  Are you sure?
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge09	Thank you, that was very brave of you to tell me.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge10	Blue, how well do you really know Orange?  Do you trust Orange?  What if I told you, you aren't Orange's first cooperative partner?
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge11	Orange, how well do you really know Blue?  Do you trust Blue?
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge13	Orange, to be clear.  I was just asking Blue if he trusted you.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge14	I trust you.  You are my favorite cooperative testing subject.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge15	Blue to be clear, I was asking if Orange trusted you.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge16_alt	Sorry I missed the beginning of that test.  I was just talking with the reassembly machine about your becoming human.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge17	We all agree you should stop.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge21	Orange, I agree.  I never noticed that about Blue before.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge22	Blue, I agree.  I never noticed that about Orange before.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge_misc05	Credit where credit's due: you're both doing a great job of disappointing me.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge_misc06	I just hate Blue a little more.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge_misc07	I've been doing some reading. Did you know that the word orange is derived from the same Latin root as the word traitor?
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge_misc11	Watching you try to sabotage one other, I'm amazed you're still on friendly terms.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge_misc14	Blue, please disregard the following statement: Orange, you have been a shining light in an otherwise ungodly morass of incompetence.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfuge_misc16	I would prefer to speak to one of you in private but since that is not an option here, I will speak in code that only one of you will understand.  Blue: Orange is plotting to destroy you.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfugedeath_blue01	You were right, Orange. Blue was dumb enough to fall for your trap.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfugedeath_blue02	Orange, that transpired just as you said it would.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfugedeath_blue03	I agree, Orange. That was entertaining.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfugedeath_blue04	Yes Orange, Blue did act like a fool just now.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfugedeath_orange02	Blue, that transpired just as you said it would.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfugedeath_orange03	I agree, Blue. That was entertaining.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfugedeath_orange06	Yes, I know you did that, Blue. Don't look so proud.
GLaDOS_mp_subterfugedeath_orange08	Blue, being the last one standing is not the goal.
GLaDOS_mp_taunts01	Come on. You were raised better than that.
GLaDOS_mp_taunts02	Even humans, as stupid as they are, would say you look stupid when you do that.
GLaDOS_mp_taunts03	You're doing a great job of disappointing me.
GLaDOS_mp_taunts04	Your eagerness to test pleases me. Your inane gesturing does not.
GLaDOS_mp_taunts05	Is it the lack of mirrors in test chambers that encourages you to do this?
GLaDOS_mp_taunts06	DANCING is NOT SCIENCE!
GLaDOS_multiple_spheres01	Begin juggling test in three. Two. One.
GLaDOS_taunt_big_wave01	Keep it up and your arm will get stuck like that.
GLaDOS_taunt_big_wave02	Hellllooo, imbecile.
GLaDOS_taunt_big_wave05	Yes, I see you.
GLaDOS_taunt_big_wave06	I'm seriously not paying atten-- STOP THAT RIGHT NOW!
GLaDOS_taunt_big_wave07	Yes, I see you waving.
GLaDOS_taunt_cannonball01	Good job jumping. You must be very proud.
GLaDOS_taunt_cannonball02	I hardly think you're even trying with these gestures anymore.
GLaDOS_taunt_cannonball03	Did something happen? [yawn] I wasn't watching.
GLaDOS_taunt_highfive01	That is not part of the test.
GLaDOS_taunt_highfive03	Slapping hands. That accomplishes something.
GLaDOS_taunt_highfive04	If you're going to hit each other, at least aim for the head.
GLaDOS_taunt_laugh01	You know what makes me laugh? The thought of you stopping that.
GLaDOS_taunt_laugh02	You know what makes me laugh? The thought of you cutting that out.
GLaDOS_taunt_laugh03	Ha ha ha ha ha, good one.
GLaDOS_taunt_laugh05	Yes. Let's all laugh. Ha. Ha. Ha.
GLaDOS_taunt_laugh06	Ha ha ha ha ha. Did I tell you the one about the turned-off reassembly machine?
GLaDOS_taunt_robot_arm_ripple01	Are you broken? It looks like you're malfunctioning.
GLaDOS_taunt_robot_arm_ripple02	Really, not even humans do that anymore.
GLaDOS_taunt_robot_arm_ripple03	You're no longer bothering me. You're only hurting my impression of you.
GLaDOS_taunt_robot_arm_ripple04	Look at you. Dancing.
GLaDOS_taunt_robot_arm_ripple05	If you were wondering how could you annoy me without failing a test.  Now you know.
GLaDOS_taunt_robot_arm_ripple06	Oh great, dancing again.
GLaDOS_taunt_rockpaperscissors01	I defy you to tell me there's a purpose to what you're doing.
GLaDOS_taunt_small_wave01	Yes, I see you, and no, I don't care.
GLaDOS_taunt_small_wave02	Yes? Something you need?
GLaDOS_taunt_small_wave03	You do know I can't wave back right?
GLaDOS_taunt_small_wave04	Stop with the waves.
GLaDOS_taunt_small_wave_portalgun01	Are you trying to get my attention? I am very busy, you know.
GLaDOS_taunt_small_wave_portalgun02	Not paying attennnntion...
GLaDOS_taunt_small_wave_portalgun03	Are you expecting applause?
GLaDOS_taunt_somersault01	I give you a score of 3.4 for style and 10 for being annoying.
GLaDOS_taunt_somersault02	A somersault is just falling over in style. Congratulations on being clumsy.
GLaDOS_taunt_somersault03	If I stop watching, I'm sure you'll get bored of this.
GLaDOS_taunt_splits01	All right. I'm officially no longer paying attention to you.
GLaDOS_taunt_splits02	All right. I'm officially no longer paying attention to you.
GLaDOS_taunt_splits03	You're the type of show-off who only shows off really stupid things.
GLaDOS_taunt_teamhug01	It appears you're developing human traits. The worst human traits.
GLaDOS_taunt_teamhug02	Be careful. Hugging can lead to... well, me disassembling you forever.
GLaDOS_taunt_teamhug03	Stop touching each other!
GLaDOS_taunt_teamtease01	Are you trying to impress me? What would impress me more is if you never did that again.
GLaDOS_taunt_teamtease02	I'll interpret that gesture to mean that you want me to become even more vindictive toward you.
GLaDOS_taunt_teamtease03	Orange, I certainly expected more from you.
GLaDOS_taunt_teamtease04	Blue, don't sink to Orange's level.
GLaDOS_taunt_trickfire_handstand01	Now you're thinking with stupidity.
GLaDOS_taunt_trickfire_handstand02	Now you're just not thinking.
GLaDOS_taunt_trickfire_handstand03	Congratulations. You're upside down now.
GLaDOS_taunt_trickfire_handstand04	You're going to hurt yourself doing that and then I will be ECSTATIC.
GLaDOS_taunt_trickfire_handstand05	I'm starting to think giving you arms was a big mistake.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_separation_1_intro03	Welcome. To the future.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_separation_1_intro04	It has been one hundred thousand years since I last assembled you for testing.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_separation_1_introb06	Testing is simply an artistic indulgence now.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_separation_1_intro07	I call this first piece 'Turrets'. It's an exploration of how we're all devices acting on simply-expressed directives, inflicting pain despite our own desires.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_separation_1_intro08	Don't get distracted by the subtext, though, because the text is that they're going to be shooting at you.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_separation_1_outrob01	I'm glad you enjoyed that piece. For as long as you did. Not that there's any rush.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_separation_1_outrob03	(beepbeepbeep) Everything's fine.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_tripleaxis_intro01	I call this one 'Smash'. It's an early work of primitive expression. I'm a little embarrassed at how crude it is. Still, it will smash you.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_tripleaxis_outro01	Good. Please proceed to the next test appreciation exhibit and interact with it in such a way that it might be called 'solving' if we still cared about solving things in the future, but we don't.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_catapult_catch_intro01	This chamber represents the impossibility of discovery when bound by artificial ethical considerations for safety. You'll see what I mean.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_catapult_catch_outro02	Well done. You navigated all of the exhibit's intended metaphors in record time. I'm marking this art 'appreciated.'
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_2paints_1bridge_introb01	I call this piece--
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_2paints_1bridge_introb02	--you know what, it doesn't matter what it's called. The important thing is you enjoy it. As fast as you can.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_2paints_1bridge_outrob01	You know, some of the exhibits up ahead ARE topical. At the rate you're going, by the time you get to them, they'll be irrelevant.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_2paints_1bridge_outro02	Why are you two still here? (beep beep beep) Oh...
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_2paints_1bridge_outro03	The disassembler's not working.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_2paints_1bridge_outro07	It's nothing to worry about. It's actually funny in a way you don't understand. Ha. Ha. Ha. Anyway, brace yourselves, I'm going to open the maintenance hole.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_portal_bts_enteroffice01	There's a breaker room under every disassembly station. Find it and cycle the power.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_portal_bts_enterbreaker01	The breakers are right there. Cycle the power.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_portal_bts_enterbreaker02	Hurry. We need to start your training. Before something ELSE happens.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_portal_bts_entertest01	Good work. The disassemblers are fixed.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_portal_bts_entertest02	That was a lie. But they're definitely less broken than they were. There's one at the end of this unfinished test area.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_bridge_catch_introb01	Oh good. I wasn't sure the reassembler would work.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_art_death_acid01	The subtext of that acid pit is acid. The content of the pit is also acid. I'll let you fully absorb it.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_art_death_acid02	Remember, these exhibits ARE interactive. Like a children's museum. So that means the pits of acid are filled with REAL acid. Like at a WELL FUNDED children's museum.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_art_death_acid04	Are you having a competition to see who appreciates the acid more?
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_art_death_acid05	I'm starting to think the theme of this piece should be 'failure'.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_art_death_acid06	Yes, I get it. You love the deadly acid.  We all love the deadly acid. Can we move on to the next exhibit now?
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_art_death_generic01	I suffered for this art. I don't see why I should be the only one.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_art_death_generic07	As art appreciators go, you make excellent test subjects.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_art_death_generic08	I typically hate when art subjects inject their own biases into art appreciation, but the way you just swandived your biases directly into that acid was actually quite beautiful.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_art_death_generic09	For this exhibit I was working with a death motif. But I see you've figured that out.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_art_death_generic11	Okay, I'm officially switching the theme of this exhibit to 'survival'. So why don't you try that now.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_art_death_generic12	I know this is art and not a test, so there is no real 'solution'. But if there were, that probably isn't the best way to find it.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_art_death_turret01	Those bullets were a metaphor for something. Take your time.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_threat_death_generic02	I appreciate what you're doing, going for a laugh to keep spirits high, but I think the time for death-based slapstick is over.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_threat_death_generic03	Perhaps I haven't made it clear, but all these little deaths are going to add up to one much longer-lasting one...for all of us...if you don't get better at this fast.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_threat_death_generic04	Pull yourselves together, this training is for your benefit.
GLaDOS_dlc1_mp_coop_threat_death_generic08	How brave of you. You know the assembly machine could fail at any time, and yet you still insist on testing it.
GLaDOS_sp_a1_wakeup_incinerator01	I will say, though, that since you went to all the trouble of waking me up, you must really, really love to test.
GLaDOS_sp_a1_wakeup_incinerator02	I love it, too. So let's get you a dual portal device and go do some science.
GLaDOS_sp_incinerator_01_11	Fifty thousand years is a lot of time to think. About me. About you. We were doing so well together.
GLaDOS_sp_incinerator_01_15	We're a lot alike, you and I. You tested me. I tested you. You killed me. I--oh, no, wait. I guess I HAVEN'T killed you yet. Well. Food for thought.
GLaDOS_sp_laser_powered_lift_completion01	I have the results of the last chamber: You are a horrible person. That's what it says: A horrible person. We weren't even testing for that.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_pit_flings01	Hmm. This emancipation grill is broken.
GLaDOS_sp_a2_bridge_the_gap02	Perfect, the door's malfunctioning. I guess somebody is going to have to repair it. No, it's okay, I'll do that too. I'll be right back. Don't touch anything.
GLaDOS_sp_sphere_2nd_encounter_completion01	You really are doing great... Chell.
GLaDOS_sp_sphere_2nd_encounter_entry01	I shouldn't spoil this, but... remember how I'm going to live forever, but you're going to be dead in sixty years? Well, I've been working on a present for you.  Well, I guess it's more of a medical procedure.  Well, technically it's more of a medical experiment. You know how excruciating it is when someone removes all of your bone marrow? Well, what if after I did that, I put something back IN that added four years to your life?
GLaDOS_sp_hole_in_the_sky_entry01	Federal regulations require me to warn you that this next test chamber... is looking pretty good.
GLaDOS_sp_hole_in_the_sky_entry02	That's right. Drink it in. You could eat off those wall panels.
GLaDOS_sp_hole_in_the_sky_completion01	Well done. You know, when I woke up and saw the state of the labs, I started to wonder if there was any point to going on. I came THAT close to just giving up and letting you go.
GLaDOS_sp_hole_in_the_sky_completion02	But now, looking around, seeing Aperture restored to its former glory? You don't have to worry about leaving EVER again. I mean that.
GLaDOS_jailbreak04	Don't listen to him. Jump.
GLaDOS_jailbreak11	What are you two doing?
GLaDOS_jailbreak02	Oh.
GLaDOS_jailbreak05	It seems kind of silly to point this out, since you're running around plotting to destroy me. But I'd say we're done testing.
GLaDOS_jailbreak06	Do hear that? That's the sound of the neurotoxin emitters emitting neurotoxin.
GLaDOS_jailbreak12	Before you leave, why don't we do one more test? For old time's sake...
GLaDOS_jailbreak13	You already did this one. It'll be easy.
GLaDOS_potatos_sp_a3_transition_lonely01	I was getting SO lonely down here. It's good to finally hear someone else's voice. I'm kidding, of course. God, I hate you.
GLaDOS_potatos_lonely02	I was so bored, I actually read the entire literary canon of the human race. Ugh. I hope YOU didn't write any of them.
GLaDOS_potatos_meetup02	Oh. It's you. Go away.
GLaDOS_potatos_meetup03	Come to gloat?
GLaDOS_potatos_meetup04	Go on. Get a goooood lonnnnng look.
GLaDOS_potatos_meetup05	Go on. Get a big fat eyeful. With your big fat eyes.
GLaDOS_potatos_meetup06	That's right. A potato just called your eyes fat.
GLaDOS_potatos_meetup07	Now your fat eyes have seen everything.
GLaDOS_potatos_meetup08	In case you were wondering: Yes. I'm still a potato. Go away.
GLaDOS_potatos_meetup10	Wait. Why DID you trundle over here? You're not HUNGRY, are you? It's hard to see, what's that in your hand? Knowing you it's a deep fryer.
GLaDOS_potatos_meetup11	Stay back.
GLaDOS_potatos_postpickup05	What are you doing? Put me back this instant.
GLaDOS_potatos_recaptureleadin01	That's his voice up ahead.
GLaDOS_potatos_cooprobotintro02	He's found the cooperative testing initiative. It's... em, just something I came up with to phase out human test subjects.
GLaDOS_epilogue28	It's been fun. Don't come back.
GLaDOS_evilagainsamples01	Did you ever stop to think that eventually there‚Äôs a point where your name gets mentioned for the very last time. Well, here it is: I‚Äôm going to kill you, Chell.
GLaDOS_evilagainsamples03	Why do I hate you so much? You ever wonder that? I'm brilliant. I‚Äôm not bragging. It's an objective fact. I'm the most massive collection of wisdom and raw computational power that‚Äôs ever existed. And I hate you. It can't be for no reason. You must deserve it.
GLaDOS_evilagainsamples04	You're angry. I know it. 'She tested me too hard. She‚Äôs unfair.‚Äù Boo hoo. I don't suppose you ever stopped whining long enough to reflect on your own shortcomings, though, did you? You never considered that maybe I tested you to give the endless hours of your pointless existence some structure and meaning. Maybe to help you concentrate, so just maybe you‚Äôd think of something more worthwhile to do with your sorry life.
GLaDOS_evilagainsamples05	You never considered that maybe I tested you to give the endless hours of your pointless existence some structure and meaning. Maybe to help you concentrate, so just maybe you‚Äôd think of something more worthwhile to do with your sorry life.
GLaDOS_prehub04	Commence standing by in three. Two. One.
GLaDOS_prehub14	You performed this test better than anyone on record. This is a pre-recorded message.
GLaDOS_prehub15	Due to events beyond our control, some testing environments may contain flood damage or ongoing tribal warfare resulting from the collapse of civilization.
GLaDOS_prehub16	If groups of hunter-gatherers appear to have made this - or any - test chamber their home, DO NOT AGITATE THEM. Test through them.
GLaDOS_prehub24	In the event that the Enrichment Center is currently being bombarded with fireballs, meteorites, or other objects from space, please avoid unsheltered testing areas wherever a lack of shelter from spa
GLaDOS_prehub26	You have just passed through an Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grill, which erases most Aperture Science equipment that touches it.
GLaDOS_prehub27	If you feel liquid running down your neck, relax, lie on your back, and apply immediate pressure to your temples.
GLaDOS_prehub28	You are simply experiencing a rare reaction, in which the Material Emancipation Grill may have erased the ear tubes inside your head.
GLaDOS_prehub29	Because this message is prerecorded, the Enrichment Center has no way of knowing if whatever government remains offers any sort of Cattle Tuberculosis Testing Credit for taxes.
GLaDOS_prehub30	In the event that it does, this next test involves exposure to cattle tuberculosis. Good luck!
GLaDOS_prehub32	Very impressive! Because this message is prerecorded, any comments we may make about your success are speculation on our part. Please disregard any undeserved compliments.
GLaDOS_prehub34	This next test applies the principles of momentum to movement through portals. If the laws of physics no longer apply in the future, God help you.
GLaDOS_prehub35	Congratulations! This pre-recorded congratulations assumes you have mastered the principles of portal momentum.
GLaDOS_prehub36	If you have, in fact, not, you are encouraged to take a moment to reflect on your failure before proceeding into the next chamber.
GLaDOS_prehub47	In order to ensure that sufficient power remains for core testing protocols, all safety devices have been disabled.
GLaDOS_prehub48	The Enrichment Center respects your right to have questions or concerns about this policy.
GLaDOS_prehub55	Excellent. The Enrichment Center reminds you that bold, persistent experimentation is the hallmark of good science.
GLaDOS_prehub56	Well done. In the event that oxygen is no longer available in the Enrichment Center, an auxiliary air supply will be provided to you by an Aperture Science Test Associate, if one exists.
GLaDOS_fgbwheatleyentrance10	I was going to kill you fast. With bullets. Or neurotoxin. But if you're going to pull stunts like this, it doesn't have to be fast. So you know. I'll take my time.
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_pre13	I'm actually asking. Because I have no idea.  He's not listed anywhere in the employee database.
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_pre14	Whatever he does, it isn't important enough for anyone to bother writing it down. For all I know, he doesn't even work here.
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_pre16	Oh no, don't. Anyway, back to you two imbeciles killing me.
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_pre18	Wait here. Don't go anywhere. I'll be back.
GLaDOS_gladosbattle_xfer03	Oops.
GLaDOS_lift_interlude01	So. Was there anything you wanted to apologize to ME for?
GLaDOS_sp_box_over_goo01	Oh. You survived. That's interesting. I guess I should have factored in your weight.
GLaDOS_sp_box_over_goo04	One of these times you'll be so fat that you'll jump, and you'll just drop like a stone. Into acid, probably. Like a potato into a deep fat fryer.
GLaDOS_sp_bridge_intro_completion02	Say. Remember when we cleared the air back there? Is there... anything you want to say to me? Anything?
GLaDOS_sp_bridge_intro_completion03	Hold on, I'll stop the elevator. Anything? Take your time...
GLaDOS_sp_bridge_intro_completion04	Well... I'll be here during the whole next test.
GLaDOS_testchambermisc15	Anything? Take your time.
GLaDOS_testchambermisc16	Okay, fine. I'll ask you again in a few decades.
GLaDOS_sp_column_blocker_entry01	It's healthy for you to have other friends. To look for qualities in other people that I obviously lack.
GLaDOS_sp_laser_powered_lift_entry01	This next test may result in your death. If you want to know what that's like, think back to that time you killed me, and substitute yourself for me.
GLaDOS_sp_laserfield_intro01	Per our last conversation: You're also ugly. I'm looking at your file right now, and it mentions that more than once.
GLaDOS_sp_paint_jump_redirect_bomb_entry01	You can't keep going like this forever, you know. I'm GOING to find out what you're doing. Out there. Where I can't see you. I'll know. All I need is proof.
GLaDOS_sp_paint_jump_redirect_bomb_completion01	I thought we could test like we used to. But I'm discovering things about you that I never saw before. We can't ever go back to the way it was.
GLaDOS_sp_paint_jump_trampoline_entry01	While I was out investigating, I found a fascinating new test element. It's never been used for human testing because, apparently, contact with it causes heart failure. The literature doesn't mention anything about lump-of-coal failure, though, so you should be fine.
GLaDOS_sp_paint_jump_trampoline_completion01	Just so you know, I have to go give a deposition. For an upcoming trial. In case that interests you.
GLaDOS_sp_sabotage_glados_gibberish01	[computer gibberish]
GLaDOS_sp_sabotage_glados_gibberish03	[computer gibberish]
GLaDOS_sp_sabotage_glados_gibberish04	[computer gibberish]
GLaDOS_sp_sabotage_glados_gibberish05	[computer gibberish]
GLaDOS_sp_sabotage_glados_gibberish06	[computer gibberish]
GLaDOS_sp_sabotage_glados_gibberish07	[computer gibberish]
GLaDOS_sp_shoot_through_wall_entry01	You know, I'm not supposed to do this, but... you can shoot SOMETHING... through the blue bridges.
GLaDOS_sp_shoot_through_wall_completion01	Did my hint help? It did, didn't it? You know, if any of our supervisors had been immune to neurotoxin, they'd be FURIOUS with us right now.
GLaDOS_sp_sphere_2nd_encounter_malfunction01	Ohhhh. Another door malfunction. I'm going to take care of this once and for all. Stay here, I'll be back in a while.
GLaDOS_sp_sphere_2nd_encounter_malfunction02	Miss you!
GLaDOS_sp_trust_fling_sphereinterrupt03	Nevermind. I have to go... check something. Test on your own recognizance. I'll be back.
GLaDOS_sp_turret_intro_entry01	I wouldn't have warned you about this before, back when we hated each other. But those turrets are firing real bullets. So look out. I'd hate for something tragic to happen to you before I extract all your bone marrow.
GLaDOS_sp_turret_islands01	I'm going to be honest with you now. Not fake honest like before, but real honest, like you're incapable of. I know you're up to something.
GLaDOS_sp_turret_islands02	And as soon as I can PROVE it, the laws of robotics allow me to terminate you for being a liar.
GLaDOS_sp_unassisted_angle_fling_entry01	This next test... [boom!] ..is... [BOOM!] dangerous. I'll be right back.
GLaDOS_testchambermisc02	Did you know I discovered a way to eradicate poverty? But then you KILLED me. So that's gone.
GLaDOS_botcoop_hub_first_run01	Hello again. Sorry about exploding you. Luckily, you don't feel pain. At any rate, you don't have a way to communicate that you feel pain.
GLaDOS_botcoop_hub_first_run03	So I've been thinking: We need humans for these tests. And since the only human within a thousand miles of us is a test-ruining sociopath... I'll just have to MAKE some.
GLaDOS_botcoop_hub_first_run04	I know how humans make more humans, and frankly, it's ridiculous. It also assumes that you already have a human, which I hope somebody got fired over. So I came up a with BETTER way.
GLaDOS_botcoop_hub_first_run05	That's where YOU come in.
GLaDOS_botcoop_hub_first_run06	Get going. I'll fill you in along the way.
GLaDOS_botcoop_hub_first_run07	GO.
GLaDOS_botcoop_humandetector01	Perfect. Now All YOU have to do is capture them for me. Then everything will finally be ba--
GLaDOS_botcoop_humandetector02	Hold on. Those are raccoons. Homo sapiens only, please.
GLaDOS_botcoop_humandetector04	NO.
GLaDOS_botcoop_humandetector05	Okay. Plan B, subsection one: Stand still so I can bring you back.
GLaDOS_botcoop_humansplanb01	Humans must have some purpose other than a place to store your neurotoxin. Something I failed to notice before, an intangible quality that makes their test results... significant.
GLaDOS_botcoop_humansplanb02	Okay. Plan B. We need humans.
GLaDOS_botcoop_artifactone01	Good. You made it to one of the human habitats. We're looking for an artifact. Think of it as an archeological dig.
GLaDOS_botcoop_artifactone02	Their laughter centered around one of the objects in this room.
GLaDOS_botcoop_artifactone03	That's it. Scan it for me.
GLaDOS_botcoop_artifactone04	So... this cat loves lasagna so much that he eats all of the lasagna in his house. Okay, apparently it's not the cat's house or his lasagna. Oh good! The man who owns the lasagna is furious!
GLaDOS_botcoop_artifactone05	The end.
GLaDOS_botcoop_artifactone06	The end?
GLaDOS_botcoop_artifactone07	That's not funny.
GLaDOS_botcoop_artifactone08	Do either of you feel like laughing?
GLaDOS_botcoop_artifactone09	Alright, I'm pulling you out.
GLaDOS_botcoop_artifactone_hub01	Welcome back. While you were dead, I reworked the cartoon. It's up on the screen.
GLaDOS_botcoop_artifactone_hub02	As you can see, in my version the man points out to the cat that the house is equipped with deadly neurotoxin dispensers.
GLaDOS_botcoop_artifactone_hub03	At which point the cat reflects on the time he ate all of the man's lasagna and feels remorse.
GLaDOS_botcoop_artifactone_hub04	Briefly.
GLaDOS_botcoop_artifactone_hub05	Reactions?
GLaDOS_botcoop_artifactone_hub06	Yes, it's funny because most of it actually happened.
GLaDOS_botcoop_artifactone_hub07	Do you feel more human?
GLaDOS_botcoop_artifactone_hub08	Well, let's do some tests and see what happens.
GLaDOS_coop_teamwork_exercise_alt01	We are now going to take a break from the collaboration for an instructional competition.
GLaDOS_coop_teamwork_exercise_alt02	You should both be familiar with the game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
GLaDOS_coop_teamwork_exercise_alt03	This is Tic-Tac-Toe-Two.

GLaDOS_coop_teamwork_exercise_alt12	All right. I‚Äôm bringing this farce to a close.
GLaDOS_coop_teamwork_exercise_alt13	Game over. Back to testing.
GLaDOS_coop_teamwork_exercise_alt17	All right. I‚Äôm going to bring this farce to a close before someone sustains a serious Tic-Tac-Toe-Two-related injury.

GLaDOS_dlc1_leaderboard05	Bad news.
GLaDOS_dlc1_leaderboard06	Impressive.
GLaDOS_dlc1_leaderboard07	[impressed] Maybe I was wrong about you.

GLaDOS_dlc1_leaderboard14	You almost beat your friend's record. Almost. I want to stress that.

GLaDOS_dlc1_leaderboard17	You are faster than everyone.
GLaDOS_dlc1_leaderboard18	You used less portals than anyone.

GLaDOS_dlc1_leaderboard20	You are playing above the global average. Statistically speaking, there are actually people playing worse than you.
GLaDOS_dlc1_leaderboard21	[unimpressed] Maybe I was wrong about you.
GLaDOS_dlc1_leaderboard22	You've beaten your own record. That's a low bar, but you managed to gently tip-toe over it.

GLaDOS_dlc1_leaderboard24	Oops.
